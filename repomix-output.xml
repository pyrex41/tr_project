MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
JANE J. BOYLE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
*1  Before the Court is Defendants JetPay, LLC's and
Trent R. V oigt's Motion to Strike Plaintiff's Expert Reports
and Exclude Testimony of Plaintiff's Expert Witnesses J.
Larry Daniels and Donald R. Smith (Doc. 190) [hereinafter
Defendants' Motion]. For the following reasons, the Court
GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Defendants' Motion.
I.
BACKGROUND
A. Expert Witness J. Larry Daniels
On June 11, 2013, the Court entered a scheduling order that
set deadlines for expert designations, expert reports, rebuttal
designations, and rebuttal reports. Doc. 22, Scheduling Order
1–3. In accordance with the scheduling order, Plaintiff BCC
Merchant Solutions, Inc. (BCC) provided a Preliminary
Expert Disclosure Statement that designated numerous
expert witnesses, including Donald R. Smith (Smith). Doc.
191-3, Defs.' App. 10. BCC, however, did not provide
retained expert witness reports. Because of this, Defendants
moved to exclude the testimony of BCC's expert witnesses.
Doc. 75. 1 The Court referred the motion to the magistrate
judge who denied it and ordered BCC to submit its expert
reports by November 10, 2014. Doc. 121, Order 8.
As ordered, BCC timely submitted its expert reports,
including the Expert Witness Report of J. Larry Daniels &
Donald R. Smith (the November Report). Doc. 191-4, Defs.'
App. 13. Though BCC had not previously designated J. Larry
Daniels (Daniels) as an expert witness, it listed him as a
damages expert in the November Report. Doc. 191-4, Defs.'
App. 13. To make the designation official, BCC provided a
Supplemental Rule 26(e) Disclosure on December 5, 2014
(the December Amendment). Doc. 191-5, Defs.' App. 24.
Defendants move to strike Daniels as an expert witness
because BCC did not designate him by the original scheduling
order's deadline, March 17, 2014. See Doc. 22. In response,
BCC explains that “between his designation and November
10, 2014, Mr. Smith began treatments for cancer.” Doc 208,
Pl.'s Resp. 2. Because BCC anticipated Smith's treatments
might preclude him from testifying at deposition or at trial,
it brought Daniels in to help prepare the November Report.
Id. at 2–3. BCC takes the position that the November
Report disclosed Daniels as an expert, and that the December
Amendment's official designation served as a mere formality.
Id. at 3. In the months following the December Amendment,
Smith withdrew as a testifying expert, and BCC de-designated
him. Id. (citing Doc. 209, Pl.'s App. 1–2).
B. The March Report
In the November Report, Smith and Daniels approximated
BCC's damages to be between $1,700,000 and $2,200,000
by comparing the valuation of BCC's merchant portfolio
before and after its conversion to JetPay's processing
platform.2 Doc. 191-4, Defs.' App. 15. On December 30,
2015, Defendants provided their Designation of Expert
Witnesses and Supplemental Disclosures, which included the
designation and expert report of Peter Davidson (Davidson)
who contested the November Report for: (1) not providing
individual merchant detail sufficient to know “why each
merchant actually left,” which “is necessary to ascertain
the true decrease, if any, in the value of BCC's [merchant]
portfolio”; and (2) addressing lost value rather than lost

BCC Merchant Solutions, Inc. v. JetPay, LLC, Not Reported in Fed. Supp. (2016)
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 2
profits.3 See Doc. 208, Pl.'s Resp. 3 (citing Doc. 191-6, Defs.'
App. 40, Davidson's Expert Report). Three months later, on
March 30, 2015, BCC served an Amended Expert Witness
Report of J. Larry Daniels (the March Report). Doc. 191-7,
Defs.' App. 84. This report appears to have been aimed at
addressing these two deficiencies by incorporating merchant-
level data taken from a survey conducted in January 2015
(the January Survey), and by examining merchant and agent
attrition to calculate lost profits. See id., Defs.' App. 89.
*2  Defendants move to strike the March Report because
of its late timing and prejudicial nature. Doc. 191-1, Br. in
Supp. 7. BCC served the report months after the November
10 expert reports deadline, 4 and, according to Defendants,
after they had conducted significant “discovery, investigation,
research, and depositions” based on the November Report.
Id. at 7–8. Specifically, eight depositions occurred between
the November Report and March Report, including the
deposition of BCC's CEO and designated 30(b)(6) corporate
representative Richard Noble. Id. at 6–7 (chart); 5 see also
Doc. 191-9, Defs.' App. 97, Dep. of Richard William Noble.
Additionally, Defendants claim to have made numerous
strategic decisions based upon BCC's November Report:
[D]ecisions were made regarding which witnesses to
depose and not depose and what questions to ask the
witnesses who were deposed. Defendants made decisions
regarding whether to depose merchants regarding the
damages sought based on the opinions and basis in
Plaintiff's original expert report. Also, decisions were made
regarding Defendants' decision to hire certain experts to
rebut Plaintiff's contentions regarding damages.
Doc. 191-1, Br. in Supp. 8.
BCC counters that the March Report, though styled as an
“Amended” report, “is more properly characterized as a
supplemental report or sur-rebuttal.” Doc. 208, Pl.'s Resp.
4. It argues that the March Report either supplements the
November Report by “incorporating results of the recent
surveys,” or rebuts Davidson's Expert Report by tackling
head-on the issue of lost profits. Id. Additionally, BCC
maintains that it has attempted to mitigate any prejudice to
Defendants “by offering to re-submit its Rule 30(b)(6) witness
[Richard Noble] (at Plaintiff's cost).” Id. at 5. Defendants'
Motion is now ready for review.
II.
LEGAL STANDARD
A. Disclosure of Expert Testimony
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2)(A) , a party
who retains an expert to provide expert testimony in a case
must disclose the identity of the expert. This disclosure
must be accompanied by an expert report that contains:
(1) a complete statement of all opinions of the expert
and the reasons for them; (2) the facts or data the expert
considered in forming his opinions; (3) any exhibits he
used to summarize or support his opinions; (4) the expert's
qualifications including publications; (5) a list of other cases
the expert has provided expert testimony in during the
previous four years; and (6) a statement of the expert's
compensation in the instant case. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B)
(i)–(vi).
Generally, a party designates its experts and discloses its
expert reports “at the times and in the sequence that the
court orders.” See id. 26(a)(2)(D). This includes designating
rebuttal experts and disclosing rebuttal reports intended solely
to contradict or rebut evidence in another party's expert
reports. “Absent a stipulation or a court order,” rebuttal
reports must be disclosed within thirty days of the other
party's disclosure of expert testimony. Id. 26(a)(2)(D)(ii).
However, Rule 26 does not address the availability and timing
of sur-rebuttal reports. “The Rule does not grant any right
to rebuttal beyond that initial rebuttal report.” La. Health
Care Self Ins. Fund v. United States , CIV .A. 12-766, 2014
WL 3720526, at *1 (M.D. La. July 25, 2014) . But it also
does not “prohibit the filing of sur-rebuttal reports. Instead, a
party wishing to provide a sur-rebuttal must first seek leave
of Court.” Id. (collecting cases).
*3  Additionally, a party must supplement a disclosure
pursuant to Rule 26(e) if (1) “the party learns in some material
respect the disclosure ... is incomplete or incorrect,” and
(2) “additional or corrective information has not otherwise
been made known to the other parties during the discovery
process or in writing,” id. 26(e)(1)(A), by the time pretrial
disclosures are due. Id. 26(e)(2). This is a duty to supplement
disclosures discovered to be incomplete or incorrect, not an
opportunity to provide information previously omitted. See
Sierra Club, Lone Star Chapter v. Cedar Point Oil Co. Inc. ,
73 F.3d 546, 571 (5th Cir. 1996)  (“The purpose of rebuttal
and supplementary disclosures is just that—to rebut and to
supplement. These disclosures are not intended to provide an

 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 3
extension of the deadline by which a party must deliver the
lion's share of its expert information.”).
B. Failure to Properly Disclose
If a party fails to provide information as required under Rule
26(a) or (e) , he may not use that information or witness to
“supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless
the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.” Fed. R.
Civ. P. 37(c)(1). The Court has broad discretion in deciding
whether a Rule 26(a)  violation is substantially justified or
harmless. United States v. $9,041,598.68, 163 F.3d 238, 252
(5th Cir. 1998); see also Wilson v. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc. ,
3:12-CV-5292, 2014 WL 1882024, at *2–3 (N.D. Tex. May
12, 2014) (Boyle, J.). In exercising this discretion, the Court
considers four factors: (1) the reason for the failure to properly
disclose; (2) the importance of the disclosure; (3) the potential
prejudice in allowing the disclosure; and (4) the availability
of a continuance to cure such prejudice. See Betzel v. State
Farm Lloyds, 480 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir. 2007); Sierra Club,
Lone Star Chapter, 73 F.3d at 572.
III.
ANALYSIS
The Court now considers whether to exclude J. Larry
Daniels's expert testimony or strike his March Report.
For each, the Court must determine whether BCC actually
violated Rule 26 , and if so, whether the violation
was substantially justified or harmless under the Sierra
Club/Betzel factors. See Betzel, 480 F.3d at 707; Sierra Club,
Lone Star Chapter, 73 F.3d at 569.
A. Expert Witness J. Larry Daniels
BCC's late designation of J. Larry Daniels was clearly
untimely and in violation of Rule 26, but after considering the
Sierra Club/Betzel factors, the Court finds that the violation
was substantially justified or harmless. First, BCC provides
an explanation for its failure to identify the expert within the
designated timetable: it brought Daniels in to help prepare the
November Report because Smith, its previously-designated
damages expert, began cancer treatments. As it became clear
he could not proceed, BCC de-designated Smith and replaced
him with Daniels. This explanation provides a reasonable
justification for BCC's actions.
Second, once BCC de-designated Smith, Daniels became its
only damages expert able to speak to the November Report.
The parties agree that the issue of damages is extremely
important in this case, and that establishing damages will
require expert testimony. See Betzel, 480 F.3d at 707 (finding
expert testimony to be essential when plaintiff could not
prove damages without it). This means Daniels's testimony
has significant importance, which supports not excluding it.
Additionally, there is no indication that Defendants suffered
any prejudice by the late designation because BCC gave
notice of its intent to proffer Daniels as a damages expert
by listing him in the November Report, which was timely
disclosed. Even so, any possible prejudice can be cured
by allowing Defendants time to depose Daniels. “[A]
continuance is the preferred means of dealing with a party's
attempt to designate a witness out of time.” Id. at 708 (internal
quotation marks omitted) (quoting Campbell v. Keystone
Aerial Surveys, Inc. , 138 F.3d 996, 1000 (5th Cir. 1998) ).6
Here, Defendants have known for some time that BCC
intended to present Daniels's expert testimony at trial. If
they have not already taken his deposition, see Doc. 299,
Final Pre-Trial Materials 19, ¶ 24(iii) (“Mr. Daniels has not
been deposed in this case.”), they may request a continuance
to do so; however, they should be able to coordinate with
BCC on a time and place to take Daniels's deposition before
pretrial disclosures are due (April 8, 2016) without need for
a continuance. Therefore, the Court finds no basis to exclude
his testimony.
B. The March Report
*4  Whether BCC's untimely disclosure of the March Report
violated Rule 26 depends on if the Court considers the report
an amended, supplemental, or sur-rebuttal report. Defendants
argue that it is an amended report. This would mean BCC
disclosed it more than four months late, clearly in violation of
the Rule. BCC urges the Court to consider it a supplemental or
sur-rebuttal report. As a supplemental report BCC could have
disclosed it up until the time for pretrial disclosures without
violating Rule 26. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e)(2). And as a sur-
rebuttal report BCC could have disclosed it if it first sought
leave of the court. La. Health Care Self Ins. Fund, 2014 WL
3720526, at *1 (“[A] party wishing to provide a sur-rebuttal
must first seek leave of Court.”).
The March Report is not a supplemental report. Rule 26(e)
creates a duty to supplement when a party discovers some
material aspect of a previous disclosure is incomplete or

incorrect and other parties are not privy to the additional or
corrective information. It is not an opportunity for a party
to circumvent the Rule 26 requirement that an expert report
contain “a complete statement of all opinions the witness
will express and the basis and reasons for them.” Fed. R.
Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B)(i) (emphasis added); Sierra Club, Lone
Star Chapter , 73 F.3d at 571 . Here, the November Report
calculated lost value but did not provide individual merchant
data to substantiate its calculations. BCC appears to have
treated this lack of detail as an incomplete aspect of its original
report that the March Report supplements with an analysis of
the January Survey. This analysis, however, does not seem
like a necessary supplement as BCC provided it to bolster
weaknesses in the November Report in response to criticisms
from Davidson's Expert Report. Even assuming the survey
created a duty to supplement, it would have been sufficient to
turn over the information from the survey itself to Defendants.
From this, the Court concludes that the March Report goes
well beyond supplementation, and cannot be disclosed under
Rule 26(e).
So at best, the March Report is a sur-rebuttal report. As
such, it was improperly disclosed because BCC did not seek
leave to serve the March Report. Doc. 208, Pl.'s Resp. 9
(“Perhaps, it might have been more appropriate for Plaintiff to
seek leave to serve the March Report.”); see also La. Health
Care Self Ins. Fund, 2014 WL 3720526, at *1 . Thus, BCC's
disclosure of the March Report was either untimely (if treated
as an amended report) or improper (if treated as a sur-rebuttal
report). Therefore, it disclosure violated Rule 26.
After considering the Sierra Club /Betzel factors, the Court
concludes that the violation was neither substantially justified
nor harmless. First, BCC's reason for its untimely disclosure
was because “the report [wa]s directed to Defendants' own
rebuttal reports.” Doc. 208, Pl.'s Resp 10. BCC argues that
“the fact that the March Report (in part) [wa]s based on new
evidence obtained after receipt of those reports constitute
[sic] reasonable explanation for delay.” Id. This explanation
provides little justification. There is no right to a sur-rebuttal,
so this “delay” was unwarranted. See La. Health Care Self Ins.
Fund, 2014 WL 3720526, at *1 . Thus, this factor weighs in
favor of striking the March Report.
Second, the importance of the March Report is unclear. On
one hand, it expresses expert opinions on damages, and
expert testimony is necessary to establish BCC's damages.
This weighs against striking the report. See Betzel, 480 F.3d
at 708  (holding that importance weighs against exclusion).
On the other hand, BCC should have provided a “complete
statement of all opinions the witness will express and the
basis and reasons for them” for such an important report
instead of disclosing a second report with different opinions
and underlying bases. 7 Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B)(i) . This
weighs in favor of striking the report. See Barrett v. Atl.
Richfield Co. , 95 F.3d 375, 381 (5th Cir. 1996)  (“[T]he
claimed importance of Plaintiffs' expert testimony merely
underscores the need for Plaintiffs to have complied with the
court's deadlines.”); Geiserman v. MacDonald, 893 F.2d 787,
791 (5th Cir. 1990)  (assuming testimony was important to
“case—so much the more reason to be sure its introduction
was properly grounded”). Thus, the Court will treat this factor
as neutral.
*5  Third, the potential prejudice here is immense. “The
purpose of the requirement to exchange expert reports is to
eliminate unfair surprise to the opposing party and to conserve
resources.” Boudreaux v. J.P . Morgan Chase & Co., CIV .A.
07-555, 2007 WL 4162908, at *3 (E.D. La. Nov. 21, 2007) .
Defendants have been deprived of an opportunity to depose
Richard Noble, as well as four other relevant witnesses, on the
topic of BCC's new damages theory, and to rebut the March
Report with their own experts.
Fourth, a continuance would not cure the potential prejudice.
Essentially, Defendants were unfairly surprised in a way
that will prejudice them either strategically or monetarily.
Even though BCC has offered (at its own expense) to allow
Defendants to re-depose Richard Noble, it cannot provide
for the possible strategic advantages they might have gained
by deposing other witnesses on the topic or by selecting
different rebuttal experts. And if Defendants attempt to gain
this strategic advantage, they will bear the cost of additional
depositions and possibly additional expert costs. Either way, a
continuance will not cure the prejudice. Therefore, the Court
finds that BCC's disclosure of the March Report violated
Rule 26 and was neither substantially justified nor harmless.
Accordingly, the Court STRIKES the March Report.8
C. Daubert Hearing
Defendants also request that the Court conduct a Daubert
hearing to establish that Daniels's “proffered expert opinions
are relevant, reliable, and helpful.” Doc. 191-1, Br. in Supp.
23. The Court agrees that a hearing on Defendants' Daubert
motion is appropriate. It will hold the hearing as part of the
pre-trial conference. At the hearing, lead counsel must be
prepared to discuss their respective positions regarding the

motion. Any exhibits that may be used at the hearing, and
lists of witnesses that may be called, must be exchanged with
opposing counsel at least three days before the hearing. Each
side will have sixty (60) minutes to argue their positions on
the motion.
IV .
CONCLUSION
For these reasons, Defendants JetPay, LLC's and Trent R.
V oigt's Motion to Strike Plaintiff's Expert Reports and
Exclude Testimony of Plaintiff's Expert Witnesses J. Larry
Daniels and Donald R. Smith (Doc. 190) is GRANTED
in part  and DENIED in part . The Court STRIKES
the Amended Expert Witness Report of J. Larry Daniels
(i.e., the March Report) but does not exclude Daniels as
an expert witness. Daniels may testify concerning the
November Report, and Defendants may depose him about it.
Additionally, the Court GRANTS Defendants' request for a
Daubert hearing.

1 Rule 26(a)(2) requires expert disclosures to include retained expert witness reports.
2 For a detailed recount of the facts of the underlying case, see Doc. 279, Mem. Op. and Order. 2–3.
3 Defendants draw the distinction between lost value and lost profits to undercut BCC's damages theory. See Doc 191-1,
Br. in Supp. 10. Davidson's Expert Report asserts that the November Report's lost value calculations do not provide
sufficiently granular detail to determine actual lost profits. See Doc. 191-6, Defs.' App. 40. And BCC's counsel stated
during the deposition of Richard Noble that it seeks lost profits damages. Doc. 191-9, Defs.' App. 111–12, Dep. of Richard
William Noble 106:25–107:20. From this, the argument goes that while BCC requests damages specifically for lost profits,
the November Report does not address lost profits, meaning BCC's expert cannot testify to lost profits at trial. Without
this testimony, BCC cannot prove damages.
This argument is incorrect. It assumes that establishing lost value does not demonstrate lost profits. Having considered the
November Report, the Court concludes that lost value, from a macro perspective, represents lost profits. So establishing
the former demonstrates the latter, at least to some degree. It is unnecessary for the Court to determine the amount
of lost value or to what degree lost value translates to lost profits; those are questions best left for the trier of fact. It is
enough that the Court concludes there is some connection between the two.
4 Defendants also point out that BCC served the March Report the day before the dispositive motion deadline. As Court
has already ruled on summary judgment, it will not address this aspect of Defendants' Motion.
5 Other individuals deposed include: (1) Shivron Enjeti, JetPay Chief Technical Officer; (2) Aliki Liadis-Hall, former JetPay
employee; (3) Dave Chester, JetPay Chief Operational Officer; and (4) Trent R. Voigt, JetPay CEO, 30(b)(6) corporate
representative, and expert witness. Three Merrick Bank witnesses also were deposed, but as Merrick is no longer part
of this litigation, these depositions have little relevance.
6 In Betzel the Fifth Circuit held that “[a] continuance would have given State Farm an opportunity to [1] depose Matlock
and Frantz as expert witnesses, [2] to file Daubert challenges, and [3] to designate experts for rebuttal.” The main
purpose of a continuance in this case would be to allow for Defendants to depose Daniels. Defendants have already filed
a Daubert challenge against him, and were able to designate experts to rebut his November Report.
7 The March Report appears to change BCC's damages theory and to rely on a completely different set of information.
Compare  the November Report, Doc. 191-4, Defs.' App. 20 (analyzing lost value, relying on processor data and files to
calculate transactional net income), with the March Report, Doc. 191-7, Defs.' App. 88–89 (analyzing lost profits as a result

of lost merchant sales and sales agent attrition, relying directly on previously unknown or unincorporated information
like the January Survey).
8 The availability of the November Report mitigates the harshness of striking the March Report.

MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
JANE J. BOYLE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
*1  Before the Court are Defendant Home Depot U.S.A.,
Inc. (“Home Depot”)'s Motions to Strike the testimony of
Plaintiff Milton Allen's experts Laura Lampton (Doc. 47) and
Dr. Shubha Bhat (Doc. 49). For the following reasons, the
Court DENIES each motion.
I.
BACKGROUND
This is a personal injury case. Allen alleges injuries sustained
on the premises of his former employer, Home Depot, while
acting in the scope of his employment. Doc. 1-5, Original
Pet. ¶¶ 7-10. Allen sued Home Depot in Texas state court
in December 2023, asserting one count of negligence. Id. at
¶¶ 12-15. Home Depot removed the state action to this court
in February 2024, asserting diversity jurisdiction under 28
U.S.C. § 1332(a). See Doc. 1, Notice Removal.
Dr. Shubha Bhat is a board-certified family medicine doctor
who has served as Allen's primary care physician since 2015.
Doc. 50, Br. Mot. Bhat ¶¶ 4, 6. In his expert disclosures,
Allen listed Dr. Bhat as a non-retained expert witness. Doc.
53-2, App. Resp. Bhat, 4. Allen anticipates calling Dr. Bhat
—and other non-retained witnesses—to testify as to Allen's
injuries, including their cause, extent, and diagnosis, as well
as to treatments received or needed in the future. Id. at 5.
Specifically, Dr. Bhat could testify that Allen's injuries stem
from his alleged accident at Home Depot; that Allen received
medical treatment to his back, right ankle, hip, and knees;
and that Allen will need hip and knee replacements in the
future. Id. at 5-6. Home Depot requests that the Court limit
Dr. Bhat's testimony regarding the necessity of future knee
and hip replacements. Doc. 50, Br. Mot. Bhat ¶ 10; Doc. 59,
Reply Bhat ¶ 2.
Ms. Lampton is a registered nurse with a bachelor's degree
in nursing. Doc. 48, Br. Mot. Lampton ¶¶ 3, 4. She is also a
certified life care planner. Id. In his expert disclosures, Allen
listed Ms. Lampton as a retained expert witness. Doc. 53-2,
App. Resp. Bhat, 6. Relevant here, Ms. Lampton could testify
regarding Allen's life care plan, related medical expenses,
and projections for future medical expenses including those
attributed to knee and hip replacement. Doc. 48, Br. Mot.
Lampton ¶ 4; see Doc. 55-2, App. Resp. Lampton, 15. Home
Depot requests that the Court limit Ms. Lampton's testimony
insofar as it relies on Dr. Bhat's assessment of Allen's need
for knee and hip replacement. Doc. 48, Br. Mot. Lampton
¶ 6. Home Depot also requests that the Court preclude any
testimony by Ms. Lampton regarding the costs associated
with Allen's loss of capacity to perform household services.
Id. ¶ 7.
The Court considers the Motions below.
II.
LEGAL STANDARD
Federal Rule of Evidence 702  permits an expert witness
to testify if: (1) that witness is “qualified as an expert by
knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education”; (2) “the
expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge
will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to
determine a fact in issue”; (3) “the testimony is based on
sufficient facts or data” ; (4) “the testimony is the product
of reliable principles and methods”; and (5) “the expert's
opinion reflects a reliable application of the principles and
methods to the facts of the case.” FED. R. EVID.  702 .
Expert “testimony is admissible only if it is both relevant

and reliable.” Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137,
141 (1999) (citing Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509
U.S. 579, 597 (1993) ). The party offering expert testimony
bears the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the
evidence that the testimony satisfies Rule 702. See Mathis v.
Exxon Corp., 302 F.3d 448, 459-60 (5th Cir. 2002).
*2  “The court decides these motions in its role as gatekeeper
concerning the admissibility of expert testimony.” Hall Arts
Ctr. Off., LLC v. Hanover Ins. Co., 327 F. Supp. 3d 979, 1001
(N.D. Tex. 2018) (Fitzwater, J.) (citing Pipitone v. Biomatrix,
Inc., 288 F.3d 239, 244 (5th Cir. 2002) ). “[T]he trial judge
must ensure that any and all scientific testimony or evidence
admitted is not only relevant, but reliable.” Daubert, 509 U.S.
at 589 . “ Rule 702  ... clearly contemplates some degree of
regulation of the subjects and theories about which an expert
may testify.” Id. Thus, “[a] district court should refuse to
allow an expert witness to testify if it finds that the witness
is not qualified to testify in a particular field or on a given
subject.” Huss v. Gayden, 571 F.3d 442, 452 (5th Cir. 2009)
(citation omitted).
III.
ANALYSIS
According to Home Depot, Dr. Bhat's testimony as to the
cause of, or need for, knee or hip replacement is unreliable
because, as a general practitioner, she is not qualified to render
an opinion on those issues. Doc. 50, Br. Mot. Bhat ¶ 13. And if
Dr. Bhat's testimony is unreliable, Ms. Lampton's estimates as
to hip and knee replacement expenses are likewise unreliable
because they are based on Dr. Bhat's testimony. See Doc.
48, Br. Mot. Lampton ¶ 6. Because the Court finds that
Dr. Bhat's testimony is reliable, the Court DENIES Home
Depot's Motions to Strike Dr. Bhat's testimony on Allen's
need for knee and hip replacement (Doc. 49) and Home
Depot's Motion to Strike Ms. Lampton's testimony on Allen's
expenses related to knee and hip replacement (Doc. 47).
Home Depot also claims that Ms. Lampton's testimony
regarding costs attributable to loss of capacity to perform
household services is “irrelevant” because Allen cannot
recover those costs as a matter of law. See Doc. 48, Br. Mot.
Lampton ¶ 7. Because the Court finds that such damages
are recoverable and estimates related to those damages are
relevant, the Court DENIES Home Depot's Motion to Strike
Ms. Lampton's Testimony on Allen's future costs due to loss
of capacity to perform household services (Doc. 47).
A. Dr. Bhat's Testimony as to Allen's Need for Knee and Hip
Replacement is Reliable.
First, the Court denies Home Depot's Motion to Strike
Dr. Bhat's testimony regarding the need for knee and hip
replacement. “ Rule 702  does not mandate that an expert
be highly qualified in order to testify about a given issue.
Differences in expertise bear chiefly on the weight to be
assigned to the testimony by the trier of fact, not its
admissibility.” Huss, 571 F.3d at 452  (citation omitted)
(emphasis added). “[I]t is an abuse of discretion for a trial
court to exclude expert witness testimony on the ground
that the witness is not qualified to render the opinion at
issue because the witness lacks a certain educational or other
experiential background.” United States v. Wen Chyu Liu, 716
F.3d 159, 167 (5th Cir. 2013) (citation omitted). “Nonetheless,
before admitting the testimony, the court must also gauge
whether the ‘witness's qualifying training or experience, and
resultant specialized knowledge, are sufficiently related to the
issues and evidence before the trier of fact that the witness's
proposed testimony will help the trier of fact.’ ” Id. (citation
omitted).
Home Depot contends that Dr. Bhat is not qualified to
render an opinion as to Allen's need for hip and knee
replacement surgeries because she is a general practitioner
whose specialization is family medicine. Doc. 50, Br. Mot.
Bhat ¶ 13. According to Home Depot, such opinions are
better left to orthopedic surgeons or neurosurgeons, and Dr.
Bhat is Allen's only treating physician to determine that such
replacements are necessary. Id. ¶ 16. Allen disagrees. He
notes that while Dr. Bhat is not a specialist in orthopedics,
she has been his primary care physician for over ten years,
serving as one of his primary treating providers since the
alleged incident. Doc. 54, Resp. Bhat ¶ 3.
*3  In support of its position, Home Depot points to
Cleveland ex rel. Cleveland v. United States, where the Fifth
Circuit found no abuse of discretion when the district court
ruled that a doctor specializing in internal medicine was not
qualified to offer “his opinion on the standard of care owed
by emergency room physicians.” 457 F.3d 397, 405 (5th Cir.
2006). The Fifth Circuit explained that emergency medicine
is a specialty of its own, and while a specialist in internal
medicine could be qualified to testify as to its own standard
of care, the plaintiff had not shown that the two specialties'
standards of care were the same. Id. at 406. Notably, the Fifth

## Page 3

Allen v. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc., Slip Copy (2025)
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 3
Circuit's determination turned on its application of Louisiana
state law that required, “[w]hen the claim of malpractice
turns on the negligence of a specialist, only those qualified
in that specialty may offer expert testimony and evidence
of the applicable standard of care.” Id. (internal quotation
omitted). In other words, the Cleveland court was applying
state substantive law to a medical malpractice claim—not
conducting a pure Rule 702 analysis as is required here. See
id.1
A better analogue is Huss, where the Fifth Circuit considered
whether a doctor specializing in internal medicine was
qualified to testify to the cause of heart disease in the plaintiff.
571 F.3d at 453. The district court determined at trial that the
doctor was not qualified and excluded his testimony because
—despite the doctor's experience in treating patients with
heart disease  as part of his internal medicine practice, the
doctor's education, the doctor's familiarity with the plaintiff's
records, and the doctor's familiarity with medical literature on
the subject—the doctor did not have “experience or training”
enabling him to say that the administration of a particular drug
“did or did not probably cause” heart disease. Id. The Fifth
Circuit disagreed and held that the doctor “did not need be
board-certified in cardiology or toxicology to explain that the
studies relied on by the [plaintiffs] do not prove a causative
relationship.” Id. at 455 . The doctor's general “training and
experience as a medical professional” qualified him to tell a
jury that the literature on the subject did not “establish a causal
link” between certain medication and heart failure. Id. Thus,
the doctor did not need “to be specialized in cardiology or
toxicology to act as a counterpoint to the [plaintiffs'] experts”
and the district court had abused its discretion in excluding the
doctor's testimony. Id; see also Holbrook v. Lykes Bros. S.S.
Co., Inc., 80 F.3d 777, 782 (3d Cir. 1996) (“[I]t is an abuse of
discretion to exclude testimony simply because the trial court
does not deem the proposed expert to be the best qualified or
because the proposed expert does not have the specialization
that the court considers most appropriate.”).
Home Depot asks this Court to limit Dr. Bhat's testimony
because Dr. Bhat is not a specialist in orthopedics. This alone
is an insufficient basis to exclude an otherwise qualified
medical professional's testimony. See Wen Chyu Liu , 716
F.3d at 167 (explaining that a trial court abuses its discretion
where it excludes an expert's testimony solely on the
grounds that the witness “lacks a certain educational or
other experiential background”) (internal citations omitted);
Holbrook, 80 F.3d at 782 . The Court's gatekeeping function
does require consideration of whether Dr. Bhat's “qualifying
training or experience” is “sufficiently related to the issues
and evidence.” See Wen Chyu Liu, 716 F.3d at 167. Dr. Bhat is
a board-certified physician who has personally treated Allen
for the past ten years—both before and after the alleged
incident—and has personal knowledge of Allen's physical
condition before and following the various procedures Allen
has already undergone. Doc. 57-1, App. Supp., Ex. B., 3-6. As
Allen's longtime treating physician with personal knowledge
of the incident in question here, Dr. Bhat is qualified to form
an expert opinion on whether further medical procedures
could be required.
*4  There are open questions as to the weight of Dr. Bhat's
medical opinion. But “ Rule 702  does not mandate that an
expert be highly qualified in order to testify about a given
issue.” Huss, 571 F.3d at 452. “Vigorous cross-examination,
presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on
the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means
of attacking shaky but admissible evidence.” Daubert, 509
U.S. at 596 (citation omitted).
B. Ms. Lampton's Testimony as to Estimates of Knee and Hip
Replacement Costs are Reliable.
Next, the Court denies Home Depot's Motion to Strike Ms.
Lampton's testimony as to the costs associated with knee and
hip replacement.
Ms. Lampton is an experienced registered nurse and certified
life care planner, Doc. 48, Br. Mot. Lampton ¶¶ 3, 4, but
she does not independently determine whether her patients
require future medical procedures, see Doc. 47-1, App.
Mot. Lampton, Ex. A, 26. Instead, she relies heavily on
the medical opinions provided by competent physicians in
projecting her patient's future medical expenses. Id. Thus, in
adding knee and hip replacement costs to Allen's medical
expense estimates, Ms. Lampton relied entirely on a letter
from Dr. Bhat stating that knee and hip replacements would
be necessary in the first place. Id. at 28. As a result,
Ms. Lampton's reliability as an expert on Allen's projected
medical expenses depends in part on the reliability of Dr.
Bhat. See Doc. 48, Br. Mot. Lampton ¶ 19.
Because the Court finds that Dr. Bhat can reliably testify
on Allen's need for knee and hip replacement, and because
Home Depot does not otherwise challenge Ms. Lampton's
qualifications or experience as a nurse and life care planner,
the Court finds that Ms. Lampton's estimates of Allen's future
medical costs—and specifically future costs attributable
to knee and hip replacement—are reliable. As with Dr.

Bhat, Home Depot can press its arguments regarding the
weight of Ms. Lampton's testimony through “vigorous cross-
examination” and the “presentation of contrary evidence,” but
cannot exclude otherwise admissible expert testimony. See
Daubert, 509 U.S. at 596.
C. Ms. Lampton's Testimony as to Cost Estimates of Loss of
Household Services is Relevant.
Finally, the Court denies Home Depot's Motion to Strike Ms.
Lampton's testimony on loss of household services costs.
Home Depot claims that Ms. Lampton's testimony on costs
attributed to loss of household services is irrelevant because
Allen individually has no standing to recover those costs as
damages. Doc. 48, Br. Mot. Lampton ¶ 20. According to
Home Depot, injured parties cannot bring loss of household
services claims because they are only available to non-injured
spouses. Id. ¶¶ 20-21. Allen's costs for loss of household
services would thus be irrelevant, as Allen's spouse did not
join the action or otherwise bring a separate claim. See id.
In support of this proposition, Home Depot cites Whittlesey
v. Miller, 572 S.W.2d 665 (Tex. 1978); Critical Path Res. v.
Cuevas, 561 S.W.3d 523 (Tex. App.—Houston [14 th Dist.]
2018, pet. granted, judgm't vacated w.r.m.) , supplemented,
582 S.W.3d 348 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2018); and
City of Denton v. Page , 683 S.W.2d 180, 206 (Tex. App.—
Fort Worth 1985, rev'd on other grounds). However, none of
Home Depot's identified cases preclude injured parties from
seeking loss of household services damages.
In Whittlesey, the Texas Supreme Court considered whether
a wife had an independent action for loss of consortium from
her husband's injury. 572 S.W.2d at 665 . While Whittlesey
briefly discussed loss of household services, it did so to note
that claims for loss of “ ‘services’ rendered by a spouse to
the marriage” are separate from loss of consortium claims. Id.
at 666. Moreover, the Whittlesey court expressly stated that
unlike loss of consortium, which is a distinct loss suffered
only by the non-injured spouse, id. at 667, loss of the “services
of the spouse” to perform household and domestic duties is
“recoverable as a damage to the community ,” id. at 666 n.2
(emphasis added).
*5  As Allen has pointed out, the Court is not alone in this
understanding of Whittlesey. See Doc. 56, Resp. ¶ 13. In Suh
v. Tyson Foods, Inc. , the injured plaintiff wanted monetary
compensation for her loss of capacity to perform household
services, and the defendant argued that only the spouse of
an injured party—not the injured party herself—may raise
a claim for loss of household services. No. 4:19-CV-00409-
O, 2020 WL 13490747, at *1-3 (N.D. Tex. June 2, 2020)
(O'Connor, J.). The court found that under Whittlesey, a loss
of household services claim is communal, meaning either the
injured party or their non-injured spouse could raise it. Id.
at *3-4. The court noted that while it may be more common
for a non-injured spouse to raise derivative loss of household
services claims, there are also cases in which injured parties
successfully brought those claims themselves. Id. (citing
Ching Enters., Inc. v. Barahona , 2008 WL 4006758 (Tex.
App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2008, no pet.) ; Hancock Fabrics,
Inc. v. Martin, 596 S.W.2d 186 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th
Dist.] 1980, writ ref'd n.r.e.)) (additional citations omitted).
Home Depot's other proffered cases likewise provide little
support for its argument. While Cuevas explained that “[a]
claim for loss of household services is derivative in nature[,]”
it was only to explain that the claim depends on proving
a separate “serious, permanent, and disabling” injury. See
561 S.W.3d at 566 . In Cuevas, the court addressed a non-
injured spouse's loss of household services claim but did not
at any point imply that the injured spouse could not also
have brought the claim. See id.  In Page, the court stated
that “a cause of action for loss of household services is
based on the loss of the services of the injured spouse” and
accordingly found that contributory negligence could limit
both the negligence and derivative loss of household services
claims. 683 S.W.2d at 206. But as in Cuevas, the Page court
considered a loss of household services claim by a non-
injured spouse and did not address whether the injured spouse
could also have brought the claim. See id.
Because the Court finds that Texas law does not preclude
Allen from bringing a loss of household services claim,
Ms. Lampton's testimony as to the cost of loss of capacity
to perform household services is relevant. Home Depot's
motion to strike Ms. Lampton's testimony as to lost household
services is denied.
IV .
CONCLUSION
For the reasons discussed above, the Court DENIES Home
Depot's Motion to Strike the testimony of Dr. Bhat (Doc. 49)
and Home Depot's Motion to Strike the testimony of Ms.
Lampton (Doc. 47).

1 Home Depot also cites a variety of Texas state cases where an expert's testimony was precluded based on their lack
of experience or expertise in a particular specialization. See, e.g., Larson v. Downing, 197 S.W.3d 303, 305 (Tex. 2006);
Milkie v. Metni, 658 S.W.2d 678, 679-80 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1983, no writ); Broders v. Heise, 924 S.W.2d 148, 152-53
(Tex. 1996). These state cases apply Texas rules of evidence and are not binding on this court. Moreover, like Cleveland,
they are readily distinguishable from the issue presented here.

MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
JANE J. BOYLE, District Judge.
*1  Before the Court are Defendant's Motion to Strike
Plaintiff's Expert Designation (doc. 69) and Plaintiff's
Motion for Leave of Court and First Amended Expert
Witness Designations (doc. 79). For the reasons that follow
Defendant's Motion is GRANTED and Plaintiff's Motion is
DENIED.
I.
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Marqueth Wilson is suing Defendant Home Depot
U.S.A., Inc. (“Home Depot”) for personal injuries allegedly
sustained as a result of an alleged incident that occurred at a
Home Depot store in Dallas, Texas on May 14, 2012. Doc.
6, First Am. Pet. Plaintiff alleges that he was asked by a
Home Depot employee to assist him with cutting plywood.
Id. at 2. In the course of cutting the wood, Plaintiff claims
the employee dropped the end he was holding, which caused
Plaintiff to “jerk and suddenly shift.” Id. at 3. Plaintiff alleges
this caused bodily injury and exacerbated and/or aggravated
a preexisting back injury. Id.
Plaintiff brought suit against Home Depot on December 3,
2012 in the 193rd Judicial District Court of Dallas County,
Texas. Doc 1, Not. Rem. Thereafter Home Depot removed
the case to this Court on December 31, 2012. Id. On February
13, 2013, the Court entered a Scheduling Order, which set
a deadline of August 16, 2013 for Plaintiff to designate
expert witnesses. Doc. 22. On August 14, 2013, Plaintiff
served his Expert Designation. On November 11, 2013, Home
Depot filed its present Motion to Strike Plaintiff's Expert
Designation.1 In response, Plaintiff filed his Motion for Leave
of Court and First Amended Expert Witness Designations.
The Court considers them both below.
II.
ANALYSIS
A. Motion to Strike Plaintiff's Expert Designation
Home Depot moves the Court to strike Plaintiff's Expert
Designations and prohibit all of the four doctors identified
therein from testifying at trial. Home Depot claims that
Plaintiff's designation was deficient because it failed to
include any expert reports and similarly failed to disclose the
subject areas and/or a summary of the facts to which each
witness is expected to testify. Def.'s Mot. 2. Home Depot
argues Plaintiff has therefore failed to comply with Rule 26(a)
(2)(C) and should be prohibited from using any information
from those witnesses at trial. Id.; Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(C),
37(c)(1). Plaintiff responds that he complied with the Federal
Rules as best he could, though “pages 141 and 142 and various
other pages” were missing from the prison law library. Pl.'s
Mot. 2. Plaintiff further claims that in August 2013 he “did
not have access to telephones to contact ‘only’ his family.”
Id. In addition he maintains he separately provided, via his
Initial Disclosures, “the content and subject matter on which
each expert's testimony is sought.” Id. at 3. Finally, he states
has written letters to his proposed experts requesting they
submit curriculum vitae and records, but he has received no
responses. Id .  He insists any expert reports will therefore
have to be subpoenaed by the Court. Id.
*2  Home Depot counters that Plaintiff had ample time
to acquire knowledge and collect information necessary to
properly designate experts. Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Mot. What's
more, Plaintiff's proposed amended filing still fails to provide
a summary of the facts or any of the opinions of the proposed
experts. Id. at 3. Furthermore, the medical records that

## Page 2

Wilson v. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc., Not Reported in F.Supp.3d (2014)
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 2
Plaintiff previously supplied in his Initial Disclosures do not
include the experts' opinions and therefore have not provided
Home Depot with notice of the doctors' possible testimony.
Id. at 3–4.
Under federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2)(B) , a party
who retains an expert to provide expert testimony in a case
must submit a report that includes: (1) a complete statement
of all opinions of the witness and the reasons for them; (2) the
facts or data the expert considered in forming his opinion; (3)
any exhibits that will be used; (4) the witness's qualifications,
including publications; (5) a list of all other cases in which
he has testified in the previous four years; and (6) a statement
of his compensation in the present case. Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)
(B)(i)-(vi). If for some reason the witness is not required to
provide such a report, Rule 26(a)(2)(C) nevertheless requires
a party to disclose: (1) the subject matter on which the witness
is expected to present evidence, and (2) a summary of the facts
and opinions to which the witness is expected to testify. Id. at
(a)(2)(C). If a party fails to provide information as required
under Rule 26(a), he may not use that information or witness
to “supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial,
unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.”
Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(c)(1).
“A district court considers four factors when determining
if such a violation is harmless: (1) the explanation, if any,
for the non-disclosing party's failure to comply with the
discovery rule; (2) the prejudice to the opposing party; (3)
the possibility of curing such a prejudice by granting a
continuance; and (4) the importance of the evidence and
related witnesses' testimony.” Reyes v. City of Farmers
Branch, Texas, No. 3:07–CV–900–O, 2008 WL 4791498, at
*3 (N.D.Tex. Nov.4, 2008) (citing Barrett v. Atlantic Richfield
Co., 95 F.3d 375, 380 (5th Cir.1996)). “The Court has broad
discretion in deciding whether a violation of Rule 26(a)  is
substantially justified or harmless.” Id. (citing United States
v. $9,041,598.68, 163 F.3d 238, 252 (5th Cir.1998)).
There is no question that Plaintiff's initial Expert Designation
did not comply with Rule 26 . Indeed, Plaintiff provided
nothing more than the names and addresses of the four
doctors on which he hoped to rely. Def.'s Ex. A, Plaintiff's
Expert Designation. This falls well short of Rule 26(a)(2)
(B), which requires a party include reports that are “detailed
and complete” rather than “sketchy and vague.” Sierra Club,
Lone Star Chapter v. Cedar Point Oil Co., Inc., 73 F.3d 546,
571 (5th Cir.1996). It similarly does not meet Rule 26(a)(2)
(C)'s mandate of “a summary of the facts and opinions to
which the witness is expected to testify.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)
(2)(C)(ii). The Court must thus consider whether striking this
designation is warranted.
1. Explanation for Non–Disclosing Party's Failure to
Comply
*3  Regarding the first factor, the Court finds that Plaintiff's
explanation for his non-compliance is inadequate. Plaintiff
attributes his disobedience to the fact that the prison law
library's copy of the Rules of Civil Procedure lacked certain
pages. However, Plaintiff has not indicated that the missing
pages actually contained the Rule in question. Furthermore,
the Court's Scheduling Order afforded Plaintiff over six
months to file his expert designation and report. Doc. 22. That
was a considerable amount of time to recognize the missing
pages and attempt to research the requirements. Though
Plaintiff claims he had limited phone access in August 2013,
he has offered no reason why he could not have contacted
individuals or performed the necessary research during any of
the months preceding. To the extent Plaintiff faced difficulty
from his own experts because they did not respond to his
requests for their curriculum vitae or reports, he could have
notified the Court of his inability to comply with the Rule by
the set deadline or otherwise sought assistance. However, he
did no such thing.
For these several reasons, Plaintiff's explanation for his
non-compliance falls short of justifiying the failings of his
designation, and the Court finds this factor weighs in favor of
striking his filing.
2. Prejudice to the Opposing Party
The second factor likewise weighs in favor of the sanction.
As Home Depot correctly points out, Plaintiff's initial Expert
Designation fails to disclose the opinions that his purported
experts will provide at trial. Indeed, it is devoid of any detail
whatsoever. Even Plaintiff's proposed amended filing states
only the general areas to be covered in the doctors' testimony
without providing any of the experts' opinions or the facts
on which they relied. See Doc. 79–1. In other words, neither
filing offers any guidance with respect to these individuals'
future testimony.
Despite Plaintiff's suggestion, the medical records he
previously provided to Home Depot do not cure these
deficiencies. The records from Drs. Kilgore and Goldings
are dated more than two years before the alleged incident at
Home Depot. Def.'s Exs. B, C. Accordingly, they provide no

## Page 3

Wilson v. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc., Not Reported in F.Supp.3d (2014)
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 3
insight into what these individuals might say with respect to
the issues at hand. The record from Dr. Batlle-a letter from
him to Dr. Jodoin-is from July 2012. Pl.'s Ex. D. It discusses
Plaintiff's injuries from an automobile accident on June 24,
2012 as well as from a work related injury in April 2009.
Id. Though the letter mentions Plaintiff had several accidents
during 2012, including in May, it is silent with respect to
their details. Id. In other words, nowhere does it mention the
alleged event or injuries associated with this suit. Similarly,
the records from Dr. Jodoin do not connect the cause of
Plaintiff's ongoing back pain and discomfort with the facts of
this case. Def.'s Ex. E, F. Though one record from June 27,
2012 indicates that Plaintiff had been treated at Dr. Jodoin's
office “for injuries sustained in a work injury on 05/14/2012,”
there is no further discussion of the accident or the injury.
Def.'s Ex. F. Furthermore, the record states that Plaintiff's
current symptoms “are directly related to a motor vehicle
accident sustained on 06/24/2012.” Id.
*4  Plaintiff has since filed a Supplemental Exhibit H (doc.
97), which includes Dr. Jodoin's curriculum vitae as well as
his “expert report.” However, review of this report shows that
it fails to meet the standards articulated by Rule 26. The two-
page letter begins with the statement that “in my professional
opinion, the accident injury that Mr. Wilson sustained at the
Home Depot on 05/14/2012 resulted in an exacerbation of a
pre-existing low back condition.” Supp. Ex. H. It then notes
Plaintiff's extensive history of injury to his low back and
mentions Plaintiff was leading a “full and active life” prior to
the alleged incident at Home Depot. Id. The letter concludes
by repeating Dr. Jodoin's opinion that the alleged encounter at
Home Depot exacerbated Plaintiff's low back complaint. Id.
An expert report must not only include a statement of all
opinions the witness will express, but also the reasons for such
opinions, including the facts and data the witness considered.
Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(B)(i)-(ii). Similarly, the report must
note any exhibits that will be used, a statement of the
compensation the expert has received, and a list of other
cases in which, during the previous four years, the witness
has testified as an expert. Id. at (iii)-(vi). The expert report
Plaintiff filed simply provides none of this information.
In fact, it seems to be precisely the “sketchy and vague”
information that Rule 26  was intended to prevent. Sierra
Club, 73 F.3d at 571.
In sum, neither Plaintiff's initial Expert Designation nor the
other records he provided nor his most recent supplement
includes the necessary disclosures under Rule 26(a)(2)(B)
or (a)(2)(C) . There is no information regarding three of
the four witnesses' qualifications, previous cases during
which any expert has testified, or statements about any of
their compensation. Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(B)(iii)-(vi). More
critically, there is no “complete statement of all opinions the
witness[es] will express and the basis and reasons for them”
and no disclosure of the facts or data they considered in
forming their opinions.  Id.; see also  Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)
(B). There is not even a summary of the facts and opinions
to which the doctors' will testify. Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(C)(ii).
Accordingly, the Court finds Plaintiff has given absolutely no
notice of his witnesses' possible testimony, and Home Depot
would be prejudiced if the four doctors were allowed to testify
at trial. See Harmon v. Georgia Gulf Lake Charles L.L.C.,
476 F. App'x 31, 37 (5th Cir.2012) (affirming district court's
finding of prejudice where appellants provided “no usable
information” in their initial expert report, deposition was
scheduled several weeks after report deadline, and appellants
failed to provide any opinions as of deadline for disclosure).
3. Possibility of Curing Such a Prejudice by Granting a
Continuance
As an initial matter, the Court recognizes that it vacated the
previously-scheduled trial date in an order dated November
13, 2013. Doc. 75. The case will now proceed to trial, if
necessary, following the Court's ruling on the parties' pending
summary judgment motions. Id.
*5  Since the Court's November 13 order, Plaintiff has failed
to cure the deficiencies identified above with respect to
Drs. Kilgore, Goldings, or Batlle. Plaintiff's supplemental
materials for Dr. Jodoin also fall short of satisfying Rule
26's requirements. Consequently, there is little indication that
granting Plaintiff more time to comply with the Rule would
be beneficial, especially when he has represented to the Court
that materials from his experts “must be propounded via
issuance of a subpoena.” See, e.g., First Am. Exp. Des. 2. It
seems more likely that granting additional time would only
result in additional delay and unnecessary expense for all
involved. Barrett, 95 F.3d at 381 . In addition, more time
would not, “in and of itself,” “ ‘deter future dilatory behavior,
nor serve to enforce local rules or court imposed scheduling
orders.’ ” Id. (quoting Geiserman v. MacDonald,  893 F.2d
787, 792 (5th Cir.1990)). Consequently, the Court finds this
factor also weighs in favor of striking the designation.
4. Importance of the Evidence and Related Witnesses'
Testimony

## Page 4

Wilson v. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc., Not Reported in F.Supp.3d (2014)
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 4
The Court now considers the fourth and final factor regarding
the importance of the evidence and related witnesses'
testimony. Plaintiff argues that the evidence and testimony
sought to be introduced is “key medical evidence that is
needed to prove this case.” Pl.'s Mot. 2. However, Plaintiff
has failed to explain how this is so. Indeed, the records
he previously provided from Drs. Kilgore and Goldings
are more than two years before the incident, and it is not
clear if these doctors ever saw Plaintiff after 2009 and
2010. Though Drs. Batlle and Jodoin did treat Plaintiff
after the alleged injury at Home Depot, their records are
virtually silent with respect to that specific trauma and
any associated examinations or diagnoses. To be sure, Dr.
Jodoin has provided a letter that states his opinion that the
incident at Home Depot exacerbated Plaintiff's pre-existing
back condition, which is no doubt important to Plaintiff's
case. However, “the importance of such proposed testimony
cannot singularly override the enforcement of local rules and
scheduling orders.” Geiserman, 893 F.2d at 792. “Moreover,
the claimed importance of [Plaintiff's] expert testimony
merely underscores the need for [Plaintiff] to have complied
with the court's deadlines or at least informed the trial judge in
advance if good faith compliance was not possible.” Barrett,
95 F.d at 381.
In conclusion, Plaintiff has not only failed to comply with
Rule 26 , but he has also failed to provide a sufficient
explanation to justify his non-compliance. As Rule 37 makes
clear, “[i]f a party fails to provide information or identify
a witness as required by Rule 26(a) or (e) , the party is not
allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence
on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure was
substantially justified or is harmless .” Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(c)(1).
Based on the filings, relevant law, and its “wide latitude”
in handling pretrial matters, the Court finds that Plaintiff's
disobedience was neither substantially justified nor harmless.
See Campbell v. Keystone Aerial Surveys, Inc.,  138 F.3d
996, 1000 (5th Cir.1998) . The Court therefore GRANTS
Defendant's Motion to Strike Expert Designation.
B. Motion for Leave of Court and First Amended Expert
Witness Designations
*6  The Court now considers Plaintiff's Motion for Leave
of Court to file his First Amended Expert Witness
Designations. As the Court has already discussed, Plaintiff
has failed to adequately explain why he could not comply
with Rule 26 regarding his initial Expert Designation. What's
more, his amended filing also lacks the required disclosures.
Finally, Plaintiff attempts for the first time to designate
an organization (University of Texas Medical Branch), its
doctors, and a physician's assistant as experts, without any
offering explanation or justification for their addition.
In light of the Court's analysis with respect to Defendant's
Motion as well as the deficiencies of Plaintiff's current
request, the Court finds no reason to grant Plaintiff leave
to file his First Amended Expert Witness Designations.
Accordingly, the Court DENIES his Motion.
III.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's Motion to Strike
Plaintiff's Expert Witness Designation is GRANTED.
Accordingly, the Court STRIKES Plaintiff's Expert
Designation, and Plaintiff is prohibited from using the
information or witnesses therein in a motion, at a hearing, or
at trial. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(c)(1). The Court also DENIES
Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to file his First Amended Expert
Witness Designations.

MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
JANE J. BOYLE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
*1  Before the Court is Plaintiff Hanan's Motion to Exclude
Expert Opinion or in the Alternative Motion in Limine (Doc.
96). Defendants Crete Carrier Corporation and Dorn Knapp
retained Andrew Irwin to give expert opinion and testimony
on accident reconstruction. Hanan moves to exclude Irwin's
testimony for alleged failures to abide by Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure 16, 26, and 37. Doc. 96, Pl.’s Mot., 1. For the
reasons that follow, Hanan's Motion to Exclude Irwin's Expert
Opinions (Doc. 96) is DENIED. Also, the Court DENIES the
Motion in Limine to exclude Mr. Irwin's testimony entirely
but reserves judgment on excluding the testimony regarding
the late-disclosed materials until the pre-trial conference.
However, the Court GRANTS a two-month continuance of
the trial date, so that Hanan may properly review the late-
disclosed expert evidence. The Court will enter a further order
with the specific trial and pre-trial conference dates.
I.
BACKGROUND
This is a personal injury case in which Hanan alleges she was
traveling on Interstate 45 in Navarro County, Texas, when
her vehicle was hit by Defendant Crete Carrier Corporation's
tractor-trailer. Doc. 4, Supp. Doc. (“Original Pet.”), ¶ 6. The
vehicle was being driven by Defendant Knapp, who was an
employee of Crete at the time. Id. Hanan alleges that she
suffered severe injuries to her head , neck, back, and other
body parts as a result of the accident. Id. Hanan subsequently
brought this lawsuit against both Crete and Knapp. Id. ¶¶ 4–5.
The Court issued a Scheduling Order (Doc. 10) on March
6, 2019 that set Defendants’ expert designation and reports
deadline for June 19, 2019. Doc. 10, Scheduling Order,
1. The Court then extended Defendants’ expert designation
deadline to October 16, 2019. See Doc. 30, Electronic Order.
Defendants retained Mr. Irwin as an expert in accident-
reconstruction modeling. Doc. 45, Defs.’ Designation of
Experts, 6. Defendants designated Irwin as a testifying
expert on accident reconstruction and produced his report on
October 16, 2019, in accordance with the expert designation
deadline. See id. But on November 21, 2019 and December
3, 2019, Defendants produced additional materials that Mr.
Irwin reviewed in formulating his expert report. Doc. 96, Pl.’s
Mot., 3–4. This was more than one month after the October
16 expert designation deadline had passed. Hanan alleges that
this late disclosure violated Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
16, 26, and 37. Id. at 2.
The contents of the late disclosure are: a data download from
the engine control module (ECM) on Crete's tractor-trailer;
additional photographs taken by Mr. Irwin; Mr. Irwin's notes
from his investigation; a dash cam video from a responding
officer; and supplemental materials. Id. at 4.
Hanan served her First Requests for Admission on
Defendants on March 15, 2019. Id. Request for Admission
Sixteen asked Defendants to admit that the tractor-trailer
driven by Defendant Knapp had an ECM device. Id. at 5.
Defendant Knapp admitted there was such a device installed
at the time of the accident. 1 Doc. 102, Defs.’ Resp., 5.
Along with that request, Hanan served Defendants with a
Request for Production of ECM data from Crete's tractor-
trailer. Doc. 96, Pl.’s Mot., 5. Defendant Knapp claimed
that because he was not in possession or control of the
vehicle, he personally had no ECM data to provide. Doc. 102,
Defs.’ Resp., 5–6. Similarly, Defendant Crete responded that
no ECM download had been completed. Id. at 6. At some
later point, however, a download was apparently performed
because Mr. Irwin reviewed the vehicle's ECM data download
during his investigation. See id.  at 4. But Crete neither
amended its response nor supplemented the ECM data within

the discovery deadline. See Doc. 96, Pl.’s Mot., 5; Doc. 102,
Defs.’ Resp., 6.
*2  Hanan now brings this motion to exclude Irwin's
expert testimony. Doc. 96, Pl.’s Mot. All briefing has been
submitted, and the motion is now ripe for review.
II.
LEGAL STANDARD
A. Disclosure of Expert Testimony—Rule 26(a)(2)(A)
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2)(A) , a party
who retains an expert to provide testimony in a case
must disclose the expert's identity. This disclosure must
be accompanied by an expert report that contains: (1) a
complete statement of all the expert's opinions and the reasons
for them; (2) the facts or data the expert considered in
forming his opinions; (3) any exhibits he used to summarize
or support those opinions; (4) the expert's qualifications,
including publications from the past ten years; (5) a list of
other cases the expert has provided expert testimony in
during the previous four years; and (6) a statement of the
expert's compensation in the instant case. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)
(2)(B)(i)–(vi).
Generally, a party must designate its experts and disclose its
expert reports “at the times and in the sequence that the court
orders.” See id. 26(a)(2)(D). “The parties must supplement
these disclosures when required under Rule 26(e).” Id. 26(a)
(2)(E). Rule 26(e) requires supplementation if: (1) “the party
learns in some material respect the disclosure ... is incomplete
or incorrect,” and (2) “additional or corrective information
has not otherwise been made known to the other parties
during the discovery process or in writing” by the time
pretrial disclosures are due. Id. 26(e)(1)(A) . This creates a
duty to supplement disclosures discovered to be incomplete
or incorrect, not an opportunity to provide information
previously omitted. See Sierra Club, Lone Star Chapter v.
Cedar Point Oil Co. Inc. ,73 F.3d 546, 571 (5th Cir. 1996)
(“The purpose of rebuttal and supplementary disclosures is
just that—to rebut and to supplement. These disclosures are
not intended to provide an extension of the deadline by
which a party must deliver the lion's share of its expert
information.”)
B. Failure to Properly Disclose—Rule 37(c)(1)
If a party fails to provide information as required under
Rule 26(a) or (e) , it may not use that information or
witness to “supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or
at a trial, unless the failure was substantially justified or
is harmless.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1) . Courts have broad
discretion in deciding whether a Rule 26(a) or (e)  violation
is substantially justified or harmless. Overbeck v. Envoy
Air, Inc. , 2017 WL 3726781, at *2 (N.D. Tex. Aug. 29,
2017) (citation omitted). In exercising its discretion, the
Court considers four factors: (1) the reason for the failure
to properly disclose; (2) the importance of the testimony;
(3) the potential prejudice in allowing the disclosure; and
(4) the availability of a continuance to cure such prejudice.
Geiserman v. MacDonald, 893 F.2d 787, 791 (5th Cir. 1990)
(citation omitted).
C. Scheduling Orders—Rule 16
Courts may enter scheduling orders under Rule 16 to manage
the timing of discovery and organize important dates in the
litigation. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 16. Barrett v. Atl. Richfield Co.,
95 F.3d 375, 380 (5th Cir. 1996) . Scheduling orders limit
the time period to amend pleadings and conduct discovery.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(3)(A). If a party fails to obey a court's
scheduling order, “[o]n motion or on its own, the court may
issue any just orders, including those authorized by Rule 37(b)
(2)(A)(ii)–(vii).” Id. 16(f)(1) . A court may “prohibit[ ] the
disobedient party from supporting or opposing designated
claims or defenses, or from introducing designated matters
in evidence.” Id. 37(b)(2)(A)(ii) . A trial court has “broad
discretion” in determining whether to sanction the offending
conduct. See Hodges v. United States , 597 F.2d 1014, 1018
(5th Cir. 1979) . Because failure to comply with Rule 16
provides for sanctions under Rule 37, the Court must apply
the same four-factor Geiserman analysis to Rule 16 violations
that it applies to Rule 26 violations. See Barrett, 95 F.3d at
380.
III.
ANALYSIS
*3  The Court now considers whether to exclude Mr. Irwin's
expert testimony as a Rule 37 sanction for violating either
Rules 16 or 26, or in the alternative limine out the testimony.
First the Court must determine whether the alleged conduct
actually violated Rules 16  or 26, and if so, whether the

## Page 3

Hanan v. Crete Carrier Corporation, Not Reported in Fed. Supp. (2020)
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 3
violation was substantially justified or harmless under the
Geiserman factors. See Geiserman, 893 F.2d at 791.
In sum, although the exclusion of Mr. Irwin's testimony is not
warranted, the Court concludes that a two-month continuance
of the trial is necessary for Hanan to properly review the at-
issue documents in preparation for trial.
A. Rule 26
Defendants’ late disclosure of some materials Mr. Irwin
reviewed in creating his report was clearly untimely and
in violation of Rule 26 . However, after considering the
Geiserman factors, the Court finds that the violation can be
best cured through a continuance, not exclusion of Mr. Irwin's
testimony.
1. Defendants’ reason for noncompliance
First, the Court considers “the reason for [Defendants’]
failure to properly disclose” materials Mr. Irwin reviewed in
his investigation and formulation of his expert report. See
Geiserman, 893 F.2d at 791  (citation omitted). Defendants
contend that the untimely disclosure was unintentional
because the materials “did [not] form the basis of the
substance of Mr. Irwin's report.” Doc. 102, Defs.’ Resp.,
6. However, oversight is not an adequate excuse for
noncompliance with Rule 26; there is no requirement that the
violation was willing or intentional. See 1488, Inc. v. Philsec
Inv. Corp., 939 F.2d 1281, 1288–89 (5th Cir. 1991) (holding
no abuse of discretion when district court found the first factor
in favor of the movant where there was no argument that the
failure was intentional and no adequate justification given).
Accordingly, this factor weighs in favor of Hanan.
2. Importance of the disclosure
Next, the Court evaluates “the importance of the testimony”
of Defendants’ expert witness to the case. See Geiserman,
893 F.2d at 791  (citation omitted). The Court considers the
importance of the expert testimony as a whole because that is
what Hanan seeks to exclude, not the late-disclosed material.
See Doc. 96, Pl.’s Mot., 6. Defendants argue, and Hanan
does not dispute, that this testimony is important to the case.
See Doc. 102, Defs.’ Resp., 7–8; Doc. 96, Pl.’s Mot., 9. Mr.
Irwin is the only expert designated by Defendants to discuss
accident reconstruction, which is of particular importance in
this car-wreck case. See Doc. 102, Defs.’ Resp., 7–8.
While Hanan makes no argument that the testimony is
unimportant, she does argue that if Mr. Irwin's testimony
is essential, than the more important it is that the proper
procedures were followed. See Doc. 96, Pl.’s Mot., 9 (citing
Geiserman, 893 F.2d at 791 ). By this, the Court believes
that Hanan is intending to argue that the more important the
testimony, the more heavily this factor should weigh in favor
of the movant.
However, this is not the intended interpretation of the second
factor because it conflates it with the prejudice factor below,
and it “stand[s the analysis] on its head.” See Betzel v.
State Farm Lloyds , 480 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir. 2007) .
Because Hanan does not dispute the importance of the expert
testimony, this factor weighs in favor of Defendants.
3. Potential prejudice
*4  The Court next considers the “potential prejudice in
allowing the testimony.” See Geiserman, 893 F.2d at 791
(citation omitted). Hanan argues that she would be prejudiced
by Mr. Irwin's testimony because she does not have “a
reasonable amount of time to analyze all of the documents
and their factual connections to Mr. Irwin's report” before
trial. Doc. 96, Pl.’s Mot., 9–10. The late disclosures contained
multiple different types of materials, so the prejudicial effect
of each will be considered individually.
The largest portion of the materials is about 300 pages of
an ECM data download from the tractor-trailer. Id. at 4.
Defendants argue that the late disclosure of the data was not
prejudicial because Mr. Irwin determined it did not contain
recordings or data from the subject accident. Doc. 102, Defs.’
Resp., 8. But Hanan is entitled to make that determination for
herself and glean any other information she may find relevant
from the data. Hanan is not required to take the word of the
opposing party's expert that the data is not important to the
case. If she feels that she has not had time to review the data,
then it would be prejudicial to not allow her that opportunity,
as her time constraints are the result of Defendants’ mistakes.
Next, the disclosures contained over 100 photographs taken
by Mr. Irwin in his investigation. Doc. 96, Pl.’s Mot.,
4. Defendants claim that these were surplus pictures that
disclosed no new information because the photos Mr. Irwin
based his opinions on were included in his report. Doc. 102,
Defs.’ Resp., 3. Additionally, Defendants say Hanan would
not be prejudiced because the subject matter of the photos
have been available for Hanan to inspect herself throughout

## Page 4

Hanan v. Crete Carrier Corporation, Not Reported in Fed. Supp. (2020)
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 4
discovery. Id. at 2. The Court agrees that Hanan has not shown
how she is prejudiced by the tardy disclosure of these photos.
The disclosures also contained Mr. Irwin's notes from his
investigation leading up to his report. Doc. 96, Pl.’s Mot., 4.
Defendants argue that this did not prejudice Hanan because
these notes helped Mr. Irwin create his report, which was
timely produced. Doc. 102, Defs.’ Resp., 3. Hanan makes no
specific showing of how this late disclosure may lead to a
prejudicial effect. See Doc. 96, Pl.’s Mot., 9–10. Thus, the
Court cannot find Hanan was prejudiced by the late disclosure
of Irwin's ten pages of notes.
The last item2 in the late disclosures was a dash-camera video
from the vehicle of an officer responding to the scene of
the accident. Id. at 4. The video shows the path of travel
down the section of the highway relevant to the dispute. Id.
Hanan does not allege that the footage shows the accident.
See Doc. 96, Pl.’s Mot., 4. Instead, Mr. Irwin used the footage
to create a scale diagram of the accident scene. See Doc. 103,
Defs.’ App., Ex. 16 (Irwin Report), 4. However, this video
could show whether Mr. Irwin used the wrong segment of the
highway, or included too much or too little of the segment
in his diagram. Hanan should have the ability to make such
arguments at trial if she deems necessary.
The Court believes that, at the very least, the late disclosure
of the ECM data download and the dash-camera video was
prejudicial and is deserving of a remedy.
4. The availability of a continuance
*5  Finally, the Court determines “the availability of a
continuance to cure such prejudice.” See Geiserman, 893 F.2d
at 791 (citation omitted). The Fifth Circuit has “repeatedly
emphasized that a continuance is the preferred means of
dealing with a party's attempt to designate a witness out
of time.” Betzel, 480 F.3d at 708  (quoting Campbell v.
Keystone Aerial Surveys, Inc. , 138 F.3d 996, 1001 (5th
Cir. 1998) ). Although here, the Court is confronted with
deficiencies in expert disclosures, not expert designations,
the Court finds that a continuance would be proper to cure
Hanan's insufficiency of time to review the materials pre-trial.
Consequently, the Court DENIES Hanan's Motion to Exclude
(Doc. 96) as it seeks to strike Mr. Irwin's testimony for any
noncompliance with Rule 26 and instead GRANTS a two-
month continuance.
B. Rule 16
The Rule 16 allegation relates to some of the same materials
(such as the ECM download) as in the prior section, but the
alleged offending conduct differs. See Doc. 96, Pl.’s Mot., 9.
Defendants’ production of materials outside the appropriate
period set by the scheduling order was a violation of Rule 16.
Although this is a separate Rule violation, the applicable test
is the same as the preceding section because they are both
Rule 37 violations. See Barrett, 95 F.3d at 380.
Defendants do not explain their failure to supplement their
response to Hanan's Request for Disclosure. Instead, they
claim that this was not violative conduct because Hanan
did not request that they do the ECM download after their
response that one had not been performed. Doc. 102, Defs.’
Resp., 6. However, Defendants had a duty to supplement
this answer with disclosure of the ECM data when it was
downloaded. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e)(1)(A) . Their reason
for noncompliance is not convincing. See Fed. R. Civ. Pro.
26(e)(1)(A). Like before, the first factor—Defendants’ reason
for noncompliance—weighs in favor of Hanan. The analysis
under the remaining three factors is the same as the preceding
section; thus, a separate analysis is not required. As such, the
Court finds that the violation will be best cured through the
continuance granted in the preceding section. Thus, the Court
DENIES Hanan's motion to exclude Mr. Irwin's testimony
(Doc. 96) for violating Rule 16.
C. Motion in Limine
Alternatively, Hanan requests that Mr. Irwin's expert opinion
be excluded as in limine relief. See Doc. 96, Pl.’s Mot., 10–11.
Granting or denying a motion in limine is within the district
court's discretion. Hesling v. CSX Transp., Inc. , 396 F.3d
632, 643 (5th Cir. 2005) (citation omitted). The Court refuses
to entirely bar the testimony and opinions of Mr. Irwin as
limine relief for the same reasons outlined in Part A. Instead,
the Court is willing to address further argument at the pre-
trial conference on the potential exclusion of the untimely
disclosed materials.
IV .
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Hanan's motion (Doc. 96) is
DENIED. However, the Court ORDERS a two-month
continuance of the trial. The Court will enter a further order
with the specific trial and pre-trial conference dates.

2 Hanan also alleges that thirty-five pages of “supplemental materials” were in the late disclosures but never describes
the content, and neither party makes an argument regarding them. See Doc. 96, Pl.’s Mot., 4. Thus, the Court will not

ORDER
JANE J. BOYLE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
*1  Before the Court is Defendant, Church Mutual
Insurance Company (“Church Mutual”)’s Motion for Leave
to Designate Expert Witness (Doc. 26). For the following
reasons, the Court GRANTS Church Mutual's Motion.
This is a dispute over a property insurance claim by Plaintiffs,
Cleburne Training & Fitness, Inc. and North Nolan Road
Holdings, Inc. (“Cleburne”) for alleged hail damages to a
roof. Doc. 1-4, Pet., ¶ 11. On March 18, 2024, the Court issued
a scheduling order setting the deadline for Defendant's Expert
Designation to August 12, 2024. Doc. 10, Scheduling Order,
1. On July 30, 2024, the parties submitted a Joint Motion for
Continuance. Doc. 24, Mot. Continuance. The Court granted
the Motion and extended Church Mutual's Expert Designation
to September 12, 2024. Doc. 10, Scheduling Order; Doc. 25,
Elec. Order. The trial is set for April 14, 2025; the deadline for
mediation is November 11, 2024; the deadline for discovery
is December 11, 2024; and the deadline for expert objections
is February 9, 2025. Doc. 10, Scheduling Order, 1; Doc. 25,
Elec. Order.
On September 26, 2024, Church Mutual served its Rebuttal
Expert Designation. Doc. 26, Mot. Leave, 5. The designation
included an expert that was designated two weeks after the
deadline. Id. Cleburne objected to the late designation. Id. On
October 4, 2024, Church Mutual filed a Motion for Leave
to Late Designate an Expert. Id. Church Mutual “seeks leave
to late designate expert witness Ronald Dutton, a metal
roof design, fabrication, and installation expert, who will
testify regarding the functionality of the roof in rebuttal
to Plaintiff's expert, Jeffrey Molnar, a Failure Analyst with
Element Materials Technology.” Id., 1. Church Mutual argues
that Dutton's testimony is necessary to establish its defense
that an exclusion provision applies, precluding Cleburne's
claim for a complete roof replacement. Id., 2. The Court
considers Church Mutual's Motion below.
When deciding whether to allow late designation of an
expert witness, four factors guide the court's analysis: “(1)
the explanation for the failure to identify the witness, (2)
the importance of the testimony, (3) the potential prejudice
in allowing the testimony, and (4) the availability of a
continuance to cure such prejudice.” Wright v. Blythe Nelson,
2001 WL 804529, at *2 (N.D. Tex. July 10, 2001) (Fitzwater,
J.) (citing Geiserman v. MacDonald, 893 F.2d 787, 791 (5th
Cir. 1990)). The court considers the four factors holistically
and “does not mechanically count the number of factors
that favor each side.” EEOC v. Serv. Temps, Inc., 2009 WL
3294863, at *3 (N.D. Tex. Oct. 13, 2009)  (Fitzwater, C.J.),
aff'd, 679 F.3d 323 (5th Cir. 2012) . The Court finds all four
factors support granting Church Mutual leave to designate
Dutton as an expert.
The Court finds Church Mutual has good cause for its
delay. Upon receipt of Cleburne's expert disclosures, Church
Mutual retained an engineer and construction specialist as
experts, designating them as such on August 12. Doc. 26,
Mot. Leave, 4. On August 20, the engineer determined he
could not complete his investigation without the opinion of
a metallurgist. Id. On August 30, Church Mutual granted
permission for counsel to retain Dutton, a metallurgist. Id. On
September 17, Cleburne agreed to provide the roof samples,
and on September 24, Dutton received the samples. Id.
Two days later, Church Mutual served its rebuttal expert

## Page 2

designation on Cleburne. Id. The Court finds that Church
Mutual acted as promptly as it could have under the
circumstances.
*2  Cleburne argues that Church Mutual should have known
that it needed to designate a metallurgist much earlier on.
Doc. 27, Pl.’s Reply, 8. However, Church Mutual argues that
typical claim disputes require the opinion of an engineer and
“usually policyholders object to metallurgical testing during
the claim handling process.” Doc. 30, Def.’s Reply, 1–2.
The Court finds Church Mutual's justification persuasive.
Moreover, the Court finds that the other three factors support
granting Church Mutual leave to designate Dutton as an
expert.
Dutton's testimony is critical to Church Mutual's defense
that a policy exclusion applies. As Church Mutual notes,
Cleburne designated a metallurgist who provided an opinion
based on his “microscopic analysis of the roof samples.”
Doc. 30, Def.’s Reply, 3. Church Mutual cannot address this
opinion without designating a metallurgist as an expert. Id.
This testimony is needed to establish whether the hail that hit
the roof caused structural or only cosmetic damages, which
would directly answer whether a policy exclusion applies.
Doc. 26, Mot. Leave, 3.
Cleburne argues that Dutton's testimony cannot be important
because it is “wholly inadmissible.” Doc. 27. Pl.’s Reply, 7.
However, the Court will not consider Daubert factors at this
stage of proceedings. Should Cleburne wish to file expert
objections, it may do so after January 10, 2025, or seek leave
to do so earlier. Doc. 10, Scheduling Order, 3; Doc. 25, Elec.
Order.
The potential prejudice is low, and a continuance can cure
whatever prejudice exists. The deadline for discovery is
December 11, 2024; the deadline to file expert objections is
February 9; 2025, and the trial is not scheduled until April
14, 2025. Doc. 10, Scheduling Order, 1; Doc. 25, Elec. Order.
Allowing Church Mutual leave to designate Dutton as an
expert two weeks past the designation deadline will not cause
prejudice to Cleburne. Cleburne still has plenty of time to
conduct discovery and file Daubert challenges.
Cleburne argues that it will suffer prejudice because it will not
have time to provide a rebuttal report or depose Dutton before
the mediation scheduled for November 8, 2024. Doc. 27, Pl.’s
Reply, 13. It also argues that it would have sought leave to
file early Daubert motions prior to mediation. Id. However,
the Court finds that a continuance for mediation, for which
the parties can move, would cure any potential prejudice and
would not disrupt the other dates set out in the Scheduling
Order. For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Church
Mutual's Motion for Leave (Doc. 26).
SO ORDERED.

MEMORANDUM ORDER
JANE J. BOYLE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
*1  Before the Court is the “Motion of JMC Construction,
L.P., to Strike the Modular Space Corporation's Summary
Judgment Response and the Supporting Declarations of Paul
Sly and Dan Sharer in Defense of Defendant Modular
Space Corporation's Response to Motion for Summary
Judgment” (doc. 37). After review of the motion and briefing,
and the history of this case, the Motion is GRANTED in part
and DENIED in part.
I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
This declaratory judgment and breach of contract case was
originally filed by JMC Construction, LP (“JMC”) against
Modular Space Corporation (“ModSpace”) on October 16,
2007 in the 116th District Court of Dallas County, Texas.
The dispute revolves around alleged damages to modular
buildings which were the subject of various contracts between
the parties. The case was removed from state court on
November 16, 2007. ModSpace filed its Original Answer on
November 26, 2007. The parties filed a Joint Status Report
on January 11, 2008 in which they estimated discovery would
take six months from entry of a scheduling order. The parties
proposed that “initial disclosures be served no later than 30
days after entry of the pretrial scheduling order by this Court.”
The Court entered a Scheduling Order on January 14, 2008.
According to the Scheduling Order, JMC's expert designation
and report was due April 30, 2008, and ModSpace's expert
designation and report was due May 30, 2008. Discovery was
to be completed by July 31, 2008.
Following an unopposed motion, the Court granted
ModSpace leave to file a Counterclaim, which was filed on
April 8, 2008. After a series of motions and responses, the
Court granted JMC leave to file its First Amended Original
Complaint, which was filed on April 15, 2008. JMC filed
an Answer to Defendant's Counterclaim on April 18, 2008.
ModSpace admits that it did not file an Answer to Plaintiff's
First Amended Original Complaint.
It is clear from the discovery documents provided by
JMC that ModSpace has missed a series of deadlines
in the discovery phase of this case. ModSpace did not
provide the required Rule 26(a) initial disclosures within
the proper deadline, or even within the time period for
discovery, and did not designate any experts. On April 18,
2008, JMC served ModSpace with its First Request for
Production of Documents and first Interrogatories. JMC filed
its Designation of Expert Witness and served its Expert
Report on ModSpace on April 29, 2008. On May 30, 2008,
ModSpace served its Responses and Objections to JMC's
discovery requests. ModSpace provided no documents in
response to JMC's forty-four Requests for Production, but
merely responded to each request that it would “produce
any responsive documents that it can locate.” In response to
an interrogatory asking ModSpace to identify “all persons
having knowledge of any discoverable matters other than
those used to support your claims or defenses[,]” ModSpace
identified only Rodney Strasser. ModSpace identified no
other potential parties to the lawsuit. In response to all other
interrogatory requests, ModSpace provided no information
other than “Defendant will supplement.” The deadline for the
completion of discovery passed on July 31, 2008.
*2  JMC filed a Motion for Final Summary Judgment
(doc. 29) on July 30, 2008 supported by the affidavit of
its designated expert. ModSpace filed its response to JMC's

Motion for Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for Partial
Summary Judgment (doc. 34) on August 21, 2008. In support
of its Response, ModSpace provided declarations of Paul
Sly and Dan Sharer, neither of whom had been disclosed
by ModSpace as persons with knowledge, identified in
ModSpace's discovery responses, or designated as experts.
On August 27, 2008, ModSpace served JMC with its
Initial Disclosures identifying fifteen individuals likely to
have discoverable information, including Paul Sly and Dan
Sharer. On the same day, ModSpace also served JMC with
its First Amended Answers and Objections to Plaintiff's
First Interrogatories and sent JMC various documents and
photographs related to the dispute.
On August 28, 2008, JMC filed its Motion to Strike
ModSpace's Response and the Supporting Declarations of
Paul Sly and Dan Sharer (doc. 37). In this Motion, JMC
provides documentation of ModSpace's conduct in discovery,
including copies of the “initial disclosures” and amended
discovery responses served nearly a month after the close
of discovery. JMC argues that both ModSpace's Response
to JMC's Motion for Final Summary Judgment and the
Declarations of Paul Sly and Dan Sharer should be stricken
based on ModSpace's (1) failure to provide timely initial
disclosures, (2) failure to substantively answer interrogatories
or produce requested documents within the discovery period,
(3) failure to designate Paul Sly and Dan Sharer as
expert witnesses, and (4) failure to answer JMC's amended
complaint.1 On September 5, 2008, JMC filed a Reply to
ModSpace's Response to JMC's Motion for Final Summary
Judgment (doc. 39).
In its Response in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion to Strike
Declarations (doc. 55), ModSpace states that “throughout
litigation, both parties have attempted to put off most
discovery to improve the chances of settlement.” ModSpace
argues the “Scheduling Order did not contain a deadline
for providing Rule 26(a) disclosures,” but admits that the
disclosures were “due within fourteen days of the parties' Rule
16(f) conference, which was prior to the January 14, 2008
Scheduling Order.” ModSpace states that it “failed to docket
the deadline for original disclosures because the deadline was
not included within the Scheduling Order.” ModSpace also
argues that “JMC's [April 28, 2008] disclosures identified
Paul Sly as a person with knowledge of relevant facts.”
ModSpace admits that it did not designate an expert witness
and did not provide disclosure responses identifying Paul
Sly and Dan Sharer as individuals with knowledge until
August 28, 2008. ModSpace also states that due to various
circumstances, it had “difficulty locating documents or
individuals familiar with the project.”
II. APPLICABLE LAW
Under Rule 26(a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
a party must make certain initial disclosures within the early
stages of litigation without awaiting a discovery request.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a). This includes a duty to disclose “each
individual likely to have discoverable information—along
with the subject of that information—that the disclosing party
may use to support its claims or defenses, unless the use
would be solely for impeachment.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)
(A)(i). The rule provides that a “party is not excused from
making its disclosures because it has not fully investigated
the case or because it challenges the sufficiency of another
party's disclosures or because another party has not made its
disclosures.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(E). Further, Rule 26(e)
requires that a “party who has made a disclosure under Rule
26(a)—or who has responded to an interrogatory, request
for production, or request for admission–must supplement or
correct its disclosure response.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e); Mills
v. Beech Aircraft Corp. , 886 F.2d 758, 764 (5th Cir. 1989) .
Supplemental disclosures shall be made “in a timely manner
if the party learns that in some material respect the disclosure
or response is incomplete or incorrect, and if the additional or
corrective information has not otherwise been made known to
the other parties during the discovery process or in writing.”
Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e).
*3  Under Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure ,
a party who fails to provide information or identify a witness
through initial disclosures or proper supplementation of
discovery responses, pursuant to Rule 26(a) and (e) , “is not
allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence
on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure
was substantially justified or is harmless. ” Fed. R. Civ. P.
37(c)(1) (emphasis added); Tex. A & M. Research Found. v.
Magna Transp., Inc., 338 F.3d 394, 401–02 (5th Cir. 2003) ;
Primrose Operating Co. v. Nat'l Am. Ins. Co. , 382 F.3d 546,
563 (5th Cir. 2004). The “sanction of exclusion is automatic
and mandatory unless the sanctioned party can show that
its violation of Rule 26(a) was either justified or harmless.”
David v. Caterpillar, Inc., 324 F.3d 851, 857 (7th Cir. 2003).
In determining whether a violation of Rule 26  is harmless
or substantially justified, the district court's decision is to
be guided by the consideration of four factors: “(1) the

## Page 3

importance of the evidence; (2) the prejudice to the opposing
party of including the evidence; (3) the possibility of curing
such prejudice by granting a continuance; and (4) the
explanation for the party's failure to disclose.” Tex. A &
M, 338 F.3d at 402 ; Paulsen v. State Farm Ins. Co. , No.
06-9546, 2008 WL 449783, at *2 (E.D. La. Feb. 15, 2008) .
A motion to compel is not a prerequisite to the granting of
Rule 37 sanctions. Sierra Club, Lone Star Chapter v. Cedar
Point Oil Co., 73 F.3d 546, 572 (5th Cir. 1996). “If the party
required to make the disclosure would need the material to
support its own contentions, the more effective enforcement
of the disclosure requirement will be to exclude the evidence
not disclosed ...” Id. (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 37  advisory
committee's notes).
III. APPLICATION OF LAW TO FACTS
The Court finds that ModSpace has not complied with
the mandatory Rule 26(a)  initial disclosures, Rule 26(e)
supplementation requirement, or with the deadline for
completion of discovery set by the Court. ModSpace's Rule
26(a) “initial disclosures” were provided twenty-seven days
after the discovery period had ended and more than six
months after they were due. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a) .
During discovery, ModSpace did not provide any documents
in response to requests for production and, in fact, its only
response was a promise to “supplement.” See Fed. R. Civ.
P. 26(e). Then, after the close of discovery and after JMC
had gone through the expense of filing a motion for final
summary judgment, ModSpace responded with affidavits of
two witnesses and exhibits that had never been provided
to JMC. After filing its response, ModSpace served JMC
with its “initial disclosures” and “supplemented” its discovery
responses. The Court finds ModSpace's dubious conduct
during discovery in this case in violation of Rule 26(a)and (e).
In deciding whether Rule 37 sanctions should be imposed,
the Court first looks to whether the failure to provide
timely initial disclosures and discovery supplementation
was substantially justified. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1) . In
attempting to justify its failure to meet deadlines under Rule
26, JMC admits that because the amount in controversy
is “less than $120,000[,]” it had “put off most discovery
to improve the chances of a settlement.” JMC offers the
Court an excuse of failing to calendar the initial disclosure
deadline and explains that there had been “difficulty locating
documents or individuals familiar with the project.” But the
statements made by ModSpace's counsel in its Response in
Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion to Strike Declarations as
justification of its failure to timely disclose and supplement
its discovery responses are unsupported by documentation
or sworn affidavits. More importantly, the Court does not
find the litany of excuses that ModSpace provides to be
“substantial justification” for such a lengthy failure to comply
with mandatory disclosure deadlines and supplementation
requirements.
*4  Turning to the four factors in determining whether
ModSpace's failure to comply with Rule 26(a) and (e)  was
“harmless,” the Court finds ModSpace's failure to timely
disclose witnesses or supplement discovery was not harmless.
See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1) ; Tex. A & M , 338 F.3d at 402 .
Under the first factor, the evidence is very important to
ModSpace's case because it consists of eyewitness testimony
and photographs regarding the condition of the modular
buildings which are the subject of the dispute. Cf. Sierra
Club, 73 F.3d at 573  (finding no abuse of discretion in
excluding testimony that “ultimately proved to be relatively
unimportant.”). However, the importance of the evidence is
not the only factor to be considered.
Under the second factor, the Court notes that JMC would be
highly prejudiced if the Court allowed the evidence because
it cuts to the heart of the case. See Paulsen, 2008 WL 449783,
at *3. JMC had no opportunity to depose these undisclosed
witnesses during discovery and had already moved for
summary judgment based on ModSpace's lack of evidence
to dispute JMC's expert testimony. In its attempt to show
JMC was not prejudiced by the failure to disclose, ModSpace
claims JMC itself had identified Paul Sly as an individual
with knowledge and therefore, could not be prejudiced by
ModSpace's failure to identify him. However, ModSpace has
not provided the Court a copy of JMC's Initial Disclosures as
proof of that claim. Regardless of JMC's alleged awareness
that Paul Sly was an individual with knowledge, it was
unaware that ModSpace intended to use Paul Sly as a fact
witness to support its case since ModSpace had not provided
timely initial disclosures or disclosed him as a witness in its
interrogatory responses. See id. (noting that where a witness
list was filed late, the opposing party's previous awareness of a
witness's affidavit “does not translate into knowledge that [the
witness] was going to be used [by the non-disclosing party]
as a witness[ ]” at trial).
In regard to the third factor, the Court is reluctant to grant
a continuance to cure the prejudice to JMC and allow
ModSpace to benefit from its failure to follow the rules

## Page 4

governing discovery. A continuance “would neither punish
[ModSpace] for its conduct nor deter similar behavior in the
future.” See Sierra Club, 73 F.3d at 573  (quoting Bradley v.
United States, 866 F.2d 120, 126 (5th Cir. 1989) ).
The fourth factor also weighs heavily against ModSpace, as
its explanation for its failure to timely disclose or supplement
discovery falls far short of its goal. ModSpace's position, as
evidenced in filings before this Court, seemed to be that the
“small” monetary amount in dispute did not warrant counsel's
attention to discovery deadlines because the case would
probably settle. This attitude toward mandatory disclosure
rules and the discovery deadline set in the Court's Scheduling
Order is viewed poorly by the courts and does not comport
with the standard expected of lawyers practicing in federal
court. See generally Sierra Club, 73 F.3d at 569–71; Paulsen,
2008 WL 449783, at *3–*5.
In sum, ModSpace's wholesale disregard for the discovery
rules and discovery deadlines in this case provides ample
justification for excluding the evidence ModSpace failed
to bring forth until a month after discovery had closed.
Therefore, pursuant to Rule 37, the Court prohibits ModSpace
from using the testimony of Paul Sly and Dan Sharer at trial
in this case. This evidentiary bar includes the declarations
of Paul Sly and Dan Sharer, as well as the exhibits attached
to those witnesses' declarations, in support of ModSpace's
Response to JMC's Motion for Final Summary Judgment.
IV . CONCLUSION
*5  For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS in part
and DENIES in part  the Motion of JMC Construction,
L.P., to Strike the Modular Space Corporation's Summary
Judgment Response and the Supporting Declarations of Paul
Sly and Dan Sharer (doc. 37). The Court denies the request
to strike the Summary Judgment Response itself, but grants
the request to exclude the evidence offered in support of
ModSpace's Summary Judgment Response. In accordance
with Rule 37(c)(1) for failure to file initial disclosures within
the proper deadlines and supplement discovery responses,
the Court STRIKES the entire Appendix in Support of
Defendant's Response to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary
Judgment (doc. 35), including the declarations of Paul Sly and
Dan Sharer and the exhibits attached to those declarations.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED , for the same reasons state
above and in accordance with Rule 37(c)(1), that all witnesses
which ModSpace failed to disclose or identify in interrogatory
responses prior to July 31, 2008 are STRICKEN from
ModSpace's witness lists and their testimony is EXCLUDED
from trial.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED , for the same reasons
state above and in accordance with Rule 37(c)(1) , that all
documents not disclosed and produced to JMC prior to July
31, 2008 are STRICKEN from ModSpace's exhibit list and
may not be used at trial.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED  that, because Paul Sly and
Dan Sharer are excluded from trial as witnesses for the
reasons stated above, Defendant's Motion for Leave to File
Expert Designations (doc. 57) is DENIED.
Based on the above disposition, Plaintiff's Second Motion
to Strike the Declarations of Paul Sly and Dan Sharer (doc.
40)and Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to File Motion to Exclude
Defendant Modular Space Corporation's Expert Witnesses
at Trial (doc. 46) are MOOT.
SO ORDERED.

Sharer (doc. 40) on the alternative grounds that the affidavits were not made on personal knowledge and did not set
forth facts that would be admissible evidence. Based on the ruling on JMC's first Motion to Strike, the Court need not
consider this Motion and it is, therefore, moot.

SANCTIONS ORDER
JANE J. BOYLE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
*1  Before the Court are Defendant Regional Adjustment
Bureau, Inc.’s (RAB's) Motion for Sanctions, pursuant to
Fed. R. Civ. P. 37  (doc. 119) (“ Rule 37  Motion”)and
Motion for Sanctions Under 28 U.S.C. § 1927  (doc. 120)
(“§ 1927 Motion”).1 RAB, represented by attorneys Robbie
Malone (“Malone”) and Eugene X. Martin (“Martin”),
seeks sanctions against Plaintiff's attorney Noah Radbil
and Radbil's former employer, the Weisberg & Meyers
law firm(“Weisberg”),2 for misconduct RAB claims Radbil
engaged in during the pendency of this case. More to
the point, RAB accuses Radbil and his firm of a litany
of litigation abuses, foremost of which is that Radbil and
Weisburg engaged in a pattern of prevarication and outright
misrepresentations to the Court and counsel throughout
the case. RAB further maintains that Radbil and Weisburg
deliberately failed to timely and accurately disclose their lay
witnesses, their damage calculations and their experts; only
to later “ambush” RAB with the withheld information at
trial.3
For their part, Radbil and Weisburg deny they engaged in
any of the alleged misconduct, and maintain that all of RAB's
allegations are refuted by the record.4
The Court begins its discussion of the sanctions motions by
summarizing the factual and procedural background of the
case.
I.
CASE BACKGROUND
A. Factual and Procedural
This is a debt collection case. As detailed in previous court
filings, Plaintiff, Timothy White, is a counselor for a Dallas-
based surrogacy agency called Simple Surrogacy. Among his
degrees, he obtained a Bachelor of Arts from the University
of Texas at Austin in 1998 and a Master of Arts from Ball
State University in 2000. 5 Plaintiff financed his 1998 and
2000 degrees through student loans. He consolidated his
student loans with non-party Sallie Mae, which transferred
the consolidated loan to non-party Texas Guaranteed Student
Loan Corporation (“TG”). TG hired Defendant Regional
Adjustment Bureau, Inc. (“RAB”) to provide debt-collection
services with regard to TG's student loans. Plaintiff did not
meet his repayment obligations, and in August 2010, TG
referred Plaintiff's loan for $148,000 to RAB for collection.
Thereafter, RAB commenced collection efforts. This suit
followed.
Plaintiff's suit against RAB centers on RAB's conduct in
attempting to collect on the debt White owed to TG.
Specifically, the Complaint against RAB alleges four causes
of action: violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices
Act (“FDCPA”), 15 U.S.C. §§ 1692c(a)(2) and (3),1692d(6),
and 1692e(11); the Texas Debt Collection Practices Act
(“TDCPA”), Tex. Fin. Code §§ 392.304(a)(4) , (a)(5)(B), (a)
(19), and 392.404(a); the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices
Act (“DTPA”), Tex. Bus. & Com. Code § 17.50(h) ; and the
Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”), 47 U.S.C.

§ 227(b)(1)(A)(iii) .6 In connection with his claims, White
sought statutory damages, actual damages, treble damages,
pre– and post-judgment interest, and attorney's fees and
costs.7
*2  The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.8
After review, the Court awarded summary judgment to White
on his claims that Defendant violated the FDCPA, 15 U.S.C.
§§ 692d(6) and 1692e(11) (on the February 17, 2011 and
March 11, 2011 calls), and the TDCPA, Tex. Fin. Code §§
392.304(a)(4) and (a)(5)(B) (on the February 17, 2011 and
March 11, 2011 calls). The Court awarded summary judgment
to Defendant on Plaintiff's claims that Defendant violated
the FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1692c(a)(2)  and 1692e(11) (on
the March 15, 2011 call), the TDCPA, Tex. Fin. Code §
392.304(a)(5)(B) (on the March 15, 2011 call) and 392.304(a)
(19), as well as the DTPA, Tex. Bus. & Com. Code § 17.50(h).
As to Plaintiff's claims under the FDCPA, based on 15 U.S.C.
§ 1692c(a)(3) , and under the TCPA, based on 47 U.S.C.
§ 227(b)(1)(A)(iii) , the Court found that genuine issues of
material fact precluded summary judgment in favor of either
party. At trial, the Court issued a directed verdict dismissing
Plaintiff's TCPA, 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(1)(A)(iii)  claim.9 The
remaining claim, under the FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. § 1692c(a)(3),
was submitted to the jury following a three-day trial.
On February 28, 2013, the jury returned a verdict determining
that Defendant RAB did not violate § 1692c(a)(3) .10 The
issue of damages on the claims Plaintiff prevailed on at
summary judgment was also submitted to the jury. The jury
awarded no damages of any kind to Plaintiff on the claims
for which he was awarded summary judgment. 11 The Court
entered Judgment on March 12, 2013, stating that Plaintiff
take nothing by his suit against Defendant and dismissing the
case at Plaintiff's costs. 12 In a subsequent order, the Court
granted RAB's motion for costs as the prevailing party in the
case under Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)  but denied its request for
attorney's fees under Rule 54.13
As mentioned RAB filed two post-trial motions for sanctions
against Radbil and his firm. RAB's sanctions motions and the
testimony from the hearings are summarized below.
II.
RAB'S MOTIONS FOR SANCTIONS
Rule 37  Motion—Failure To Disclose Plaintiff's Actual
Damages, Counseling Efforts and Experts
Shortly after the jury trial ended, RAB filed its Rule 37
motion in which it argued that, during discovery, Radbil failed
to disclose and otherwise misrepresented key information
sought by RAB on three evidentiary issues. The first of these
regards Plaintiff's damages. RAB claims that, in Plaintiff's
initial disclosures and at his pretrial deposition, he stated he
incurred only $1500 in actual damages, and sustained no out-
of-pocket costs. RAB asserts that it relied on this information
in preparing for trial only to have Radbil “ambush” it with
undisclosed damages evidence at trial. Radbil did this, RAB
maintains, by offering testimony at trial from Plaintiff that
he had, in fact, incurred $40,000 in excess loan fees due to
RAB's conduct and that he had sustained another $5000 in
actual damages when he “had to drop [teaching] a class” due
to the stress caused by RAB's collection efforts.14
Second, RAB maintains that, despite Plaintiff's representation
in his pretrial disclosures that he had received no professional
counseling as a result of RAB's debt collection activities, 15
at trial—much to the surprise of RAB—Radbil attempted to
introduce evidence that Plaintiff had sought counseling due
to RAB's collection efforts.16 RAB maintains that the entry of
this ‘surprise’ evidence was an attempt by Radbil to deprive
it of its ability to defend itself on the issue of whether Plaintiff
had incurred damages due to counseling efforts.
*3  Third, RAB claims that Radbill made an untimely
attempt to add previously undisclosed witnesses 17 to
Plaintiff's witness list—some of whom appeared to be
potential experts—even though the expert designation
deadline of June 4, 2012 had long passed. RAB states it filed
objections to these new disclosures18 focusing in particular
on the undisclosed experts. Radbil responded on February
13, 2013 (in doc. 90), to RAB's pretrial motion to strike
experts (see doc. 75), by denying experts would testify in the
following statement to the Court:
Expert testimony is not required for Dr. White to
prove the actual damages that he suffered as a result
of RAB's legitimately abusive, deceptive, and harassing
debt collection practices, several of which this Court
has determined violate the FDCPA and TDCA as a
matter of law. No experts have been designated by either

party in this case and, therefore, there are none to
strike. RAB's motion is frivolous, serves only to multiply
proceedings unnecessarily, and should respectfully be
denied.19 (emphasis added).
Less than one week later, however, on February 18, 2013
and just days before trial, RAB notes that Radbil stated
in Plaintiff's response (doc. 95) to RAB's objection to
Plaintiff's pretrial disclosures (doc. 76), that 20 “... [c]ontrary
to [RAB's] claims and speculative argument, Dr. White ...
timely disclosed each fact witness—one of whom will provide
expert testimony....”21 (emphasis added).
Radbil denies all of the foregoing allegations in RAB's
Rule 37  Motion, insisting that: “... (1) Dr. White
disclosed the counseling and treatment through his original
interrogatory answers and deposition testimony, 22 (2) Dr.
White supplemented his disclosures and discovery responses
with his actual damages; and that (3) Dr. White's counsel
neither intended to, nor did, offer any expert testimony at
trial.”23
In its Reply, RAB hotly disputes the version of events
offered by Radbil in his Response. As to the damages issue,
RAB maintains that Radbil's claim that Plaintiff's disclosures
“placed RAB on notice of a significantly higher measure of
actual and economic damages” is flatly contradicted by the
record which includes, inter alia, White's December 15, 2011
deposition testimony.24
As to the counseling efforts, RAB, again, in its Reply,
references specific portions of White's December 15, 2011
pretrial deposition testimony contradicting Radbil's account
and substantiating RAB's position that White never disclosed
any counseling efforts prior to trial. Specifically, RAB
refers to Plaintiff's pretrial deposition where its counsel
asked Plaintiff whether he undertook any counseling efforts
(resulting from RAB's debt collection activities). White
answered that he had not talked to his doctor or any other
healthcare provider about RAB's debt collection activity. 25
RAB further points to White's deposition testimony that he
had never discussed his panic attacks with any healthcare
provider other than Dr. Cush, his rheumatologist. 26 RAB
further notes that White testified at his deposition that he
had not sought counseling from Dr. Cush or any other
psychologist or psychiatrist.27 As further evidence that Radbil
had not disclosed White's counseling efforts prior to trial,
RAB refers to an interrogatory asking White the following
question:
*4  INTERROGATORY NO. 23 : If you likely will
require medical and/or psychiatric treatment in the future
with respect to the symptoms of stress and/or mental
anguish alleged in Plaintiff's Original Petition, state the
name and address of each person who has advised you that
you will likely require medical and/or psychiatric treatment
in the future, the treatment you will likely receive, the date
such treatment will likely be received, and the cost of such
future medical and/or psychiatric treatment.
To which White answered:
ANSWER: None. Plaintiff hereby expressly reserves the
right to supplement this response throughout the continuing
course of discovery
So far as Radbil's contention in his Response that White
had testified “extensively” at his deposition about counseling
he sought at Texas A&M, RAB again strongly discounts
Radbil's contention, referring the Court to White's deposition
in which he testified that the extent of his counseling at
A&M was scheduling an appointment and then cancelling the
appointment and not rescheduling or following through with
any counseling.28
Finally, RAB notes that Radbil failed to even address in his
Response why he gave his inconsistent responses to the Court
in docs. 90 and 95 in his pretrial filings regarding his intent
to present expert testimony.29
§ 1927 Motion
In its § 1927  Motion, RAB complains about conduct by
Radbil and his firm that spans the pretrial, trial and post-
trial phases of this case. RAB maintains that Radbil and the
Weisberg firm “unreasonably and vexatiously multiplied the
proceedings in this case” by refusing to make a settlement
demand, failing to cooperate during discovery and by
withholding discoverable information. RAB further charges
that Radbil and the Weisberg firm filed unnecessary motions
and delayed the course of trial with disingenuous objections
and obstructionist trial tactics. 30 RAB further grounds its §
1927 Motion on Radbil and Weisburg's general “dishonest”
conduct toward the Court and counsel.31
Radbil and the Weisberg firm deny all of RAB's accusations
and oppose sanctions under § 1927.

To sum up, the foregoing litany of allegations against Radbil
and Weisberg in RAB's motions paint a troubling picture
of misconduct by Radbil and his firm during the pendency
of this case. The seriousness of the events described in the
motions, the bulk of which were witnessed by the undersigned
during the proceedings, prompted the Court to schedule an
evidentiary hearing on the motions.32 Unfortunately, instead
of resolving any of the issues, the hearing served only to
expand the Court's concerns about Radbil and Weisburg/
Meyers. Put simply, what started as a single hearing on
whether sanctions should be ordered on RAB's motions,
morphed into an multi-hearing inquiry by the Court about the
overall tactics and ethics of Radbil and the Weisberg firm.
III.
EVIDENCE AND FACTUAL FINDINGS
Evidence Considered—Generally
A considerable portion of the evidence relied on by the
Court in deciding the sanctions motions was derived from
the trial and sanctions proceedings themselves. Specifically,
transcripts of the pretrial, trial and post-trial sanctions
hearings—over which this Court presided—constitute a
significant part of the evidentiary record on the sanctions
issue. In addition, the parties submitted a multitude of exhibits
appended to their briefing on the sanctions motions as well
as numerous exhibits admitted at the sanctions hearings. The
transcripts, the briefing and the exhibits—along with the
Court's first-hand observation of the proceedings—form the
evidentiary basis for the Court's credibility determinations,
its findings of fact and for its ultimate finding that Radbil
and Weisburg partner Marshall Myers engaged in bad faith
conduct warranting sanctions.
*5  It is also important to note at the outset of the
Court's evidentiary review that the unusually large volume
of evidence submitted by the parties, combined with the
convoluted and inconsistent nature of Radbil and Myers'
defenses to the accusations, made organizing the proof
challenging at best. In fact, so inconsistent were Radbil's
defenses to the accusations during the trial and at the
later sanctions hearings, that his overall credibility as a
competent, believable advocate suffered greatly. Moreover,
the nature of the conduct underlying the sanctions analysis
—Radbil's questionable trial tactics combined with his
numerous inconsistent excuses for his conduct, which started
during the trial and continued throughout the sanctions
hearings—required a certain amount of repetition by the
Court in its fact findings and, hence, produced this lengthy
opinion. With that backdrop, the Court turns to the facts.
Pre-Trial and Trial Conduct
Pretrial
1. The pretrial discovery phase of this case was marked
by numerous disputes, all of which were overseen and
resolved by Magistrate Judge Jeff Kaplan prior to trial—with
minimal involvement by this Court. Although the pretrial
acrimony was troubling, scant mention was made of the
discovery disputes at the pretrial conference (“PTC”). Instead,
discovery issues were referenced tangentially and only to the
extent that Radbill re-urged certain discovery issues that had
either already been resolved during discovery or should have
been.33 Perplexingly, it was not clear to this Court as the
pretrial conference commenced, which side was responsible
for the inordinately high number of skirmishes and the
mutual discord that pervaded the pretrial phase. Nonetheless,
as the trial progressed, the fog cleared and the Court's
opinion—once informed—shifted dramatically. Specifically,
a disturbing pattern of troubling conduct on Radbil's part
began to emerge, ranging from a defiant, unprofessional
attitude to making outright misrepresentations to the Court
and RAB's counsel.
2. First, as the Court began to interact with Radbil during the
PTC, it noted a few missteps on his part which—at first blush
—appeared those of a new lawyer learning the ropes of trial
practice. For example, RAB's counsel, Robbie Malone, stated
at the pretrial conference (without protest from Radbil) that
he failed to timely return her “ten” calls and “ten” e-mails
over the weekend before trial as she attempted to comply with
this Court's Pretrial Order entered the preceding Friday. The
order had directed the parties to attempt to resolve certain
issues before the pretrial conference. 34 Radbil also made
an untimely attempt to add witnesses to his witness list;
witnesses that he had never timely or properly disclosed to
RAB.35 Moreover, Radbil exhibited considerable confusion
during the pretrial proceedings over how to properly present
his opening statement to the jury.36 And he failed to provide a
copy of his marked exhibits to the Court at anytime during the
trial despite being directed to do so in the Pretrial Order.37 He
continually assured the Court during the trial that he had the
exhibits and would provide them to the Court. He never did.

Trial
Counseling
3. From the Court's vantage point, Radbil's ‘novice-lawyer’
missteps began to appear more purposeful than hapless during
his direct examination of Plaintiff White. Specifically, Radbil
posed a question to Plaintiff about whether he had sought
treatment as a result of RAB's debt collection efforts, asking;
“[a]nd have you sought any counseling or treatment as a
result?”38 RAB immediately objected to Radbil's question as
an attempt to elicit evidence relating to damages that had not
been disclosed during discovery. This prompted the Court to
call a bench conference. 39 At the bench conference, when
asked to respond to RAB's objection, Radbil oddly answered,
that even though he had asked the question, he did not know
what Plaintiff's answer to the question would be.40 Confused,
the Court followed up by asking Radbil: “I'm assuming you
must be looking for something favorable or you wouldn't
have asked it [the question].” 41 To which Radbil curiously
responded: “sure.” 42 The Court then asked Radbil: “[d]o
you think [Plaintiff] ... [is] going to say [that he sought no
counseling]?” to which Radbil responded: “no.”43 The Court
then sustained RAB's objection and resumed the trial.44
*6  Radbil's response to the Court's questions at sidebar
as to why he asked the question regarding counseling of
Plaintiff; stating first that he did not know  what the answer
would be only to agree a few minutes later, under further
questioning by the Court, that he assumed the answer would
be favorable, began the steady erosion of his credibility.
Further, this interaction began the first in a series of internally
inconsistent explanations given by Radbil for his questionable
behavior.
$45,000 Actual Damages—Surprise Testimony
4. Later during the trial, also in connection with Plaintiff's
damages—and contrary to his pretrial stance—Radbill asked
Plaintiff about the present “status” of his loans, which
evoked a response from White stating—for the first time
since the inception of the case—that he had incurred an
additional $40,000  in excess fees due to RAB's refusal
to work with him on a repayment schedule. 45 Also later
during the proceedings, and again contradicting his pretrial
disclosures and his deposition testimony, White testified, on
questioning by Malone, that he lost an additional $5000 when
RAB's activities caused him to have to drop a teaching class.46
When RAB's counsel questioned him on the inconsistency
between his trial testimony and pretrial disclosures, Plaintiff
conceded the contradiction and agreed with RAB's counsel
that he (Plaintiff) had testified in his pretrial deposition that
—at the time of the deposition—he was not aware of any
“current economic damages” or money “out-of-pocket” as a
result of RAB' actions.47
$45,000 Damages Testimony—RAB Objects—Radbil's Three
Conflicting Excuses
5. At the close of the trial proceedings for that day, Malone
complained to the Court about the unexpected $45,000 in
damages testimony, arguing that Radbil had knowingly failed
to disclose the $5000 and $40,000 damages figures to RAB
during discovery, including during White's deposition, or at
any time during the pretrial proceedings and was attempting
to “ambush” RAB at trial. 48 When asked for a response
by the Court, Radbil responded by indicating the figures
had been disclosed: “... in our supplemental disclosures, our
pretrial disclosures, we have amended that. I believe with
respect to the charges that Mr. White incurred, he incurred
those after the deposition.” 49 To this the Court inquired:
“Where are the submissions that give them [RAB] notice
of the amount of damages that you are seeking outside of
the initial response Ms. Malone referred to ? Where are
they [$45,000] disclosed?”50 Radbil responded by providing
three internally inconsistent explanations for his actions. 51
Radbil first insisted again that he had in fact disclosed the
$5000 and $40,000 to RAB “in the pretrial order” and “at
the mediated settlement” conference. But Radbil could not
substantiate this claim in the referenced materials or anywhere
else in the record for that matter. 52 Upon further delving by
the Court, Radbil shifted to a second explanation that the
$5,000 and $40,000 figures were actually not “quantified” in
the pretrial disclosures but insisting that RAB had “been on
notice of a significant amount of [Plaintiff's] actual damage
for a long time.”53 Appearing then to abandon his insistence
that the actual figures had ever been disclosed, Radbil shifted
theories for the third time, expressing dismay that the $5,000
and $40,000 figures even had to be disclosed in their “exact
amount”54 because they were based on Plaintiff's “mental
anguish and emotional distress” and for the jury and not
the Plaintiff to quantify. 55 Radbil never explained how the
$40,000 and $5000 figures, he defended as properly in
evidence, were not quantifiable given that the figures were
derived from testimony by Plaintiff about his actual out-

of-pocket losses—as opposed to abstract emotional/mental
anguish damages—due to RAB's debt collection activities.
From the Court's perspective, Radbil appeared to be‘making
it up as he went along’ in a litany of internally inconsistent
explanations to the Court.
Second Deposition Argument by Radbil
*7  6. Another disturbing event—in keeping with Radbil's
pattern of prevarication and evasiveness—that occurred at
the close of the trial testimony was when Radbil insisted he
needed to recall Robert F. Wyatt, the Director of Compliance
for Human Resources for RAB. Radbil urged the Court to
allow him to recall Wyatt as a “corporate representative” even
though Radbil had already called him to the witness stand and
questioned him at length. Radbil's excuse for recalling Wyatt
was that Wyatt had given insufficient answers at his pretrial
deposition. To support his position that the deposition was
faulty and inadequate, Radbill quoted from that deposition
to the Court. Disconcertingly, a few minutes later, RAB's
counsel pointed out—and Radbil conceded—that Radbil, in
arguing to recall Wyatt, had disingenuously been quoting
from Wyatt's first pretrial deposition. When, in fact, the
magistrate judge on Radbil's motion had permitted Radbil a
second pretrial deposition to re-explore this very topic with
Wyatt who, in preparation, had educated himself on the topic
and had testified for 45 minutes at the second deposition
under questioning by Radbil. 56 Moreover, Radbil had asked
Wyatt the same-type questions in the second deposition that
he sought to ask by recalling Wyatt to the stand on direct
examination at trial—all the while justifying recalling White
by pointing to the inadequacies in the first deposition.57
Warning by the Court
7. At the close of the foregoing discussion, the parties rested.
Radbil's trial missteps coupled with the disturbingly circular
explanations for his conduct prompted a warning from the
Court. The Court admonished Radbil about his tactics, stating
to him:“I am concerned about your conduct in this case....
[W]hat I have seen here is disingenuous behavior ... that
seems to skirt the truth in more that one respect.”58 The Court
then adjourned for the day but instructed the parties to appear
the next day by 8:00 am to finalize the jury instructions and
present their closing arguments to the jury.59
Second Day of Trial—Radbil's No-Show and White's
Admission to the Court in Radbil's Absence That He Had
Quantified his Damages
8. The following day, the Court, RAB's counsel, Malone and
Martin, and Radbil's client, Timothy White, were present in
court at 8:00 am as directed. Radbil, however, was nowhere to
be found; he neither appeared nor called the Court to explain
his absence. By 9:00 am Radbil had still not appeared nor had
he called the Court. At ten minutes after 9:00 am, the Court
convened proceedings in the courtroom and asked Plaintiff if
he had heard anything from the still-absent Radbil. Plaintiff
stated that he had not heard from Radbil and that they had
agreed to meet at 7:00 am that morning. 60 Plaintiff, looking
exasperated, stated he had left several unreturned messages
for Radbil and did not know what was going on.61 The Court
then asked Plaintiff if he would like time to try to reach
Radbil again and decide how to proceed; to which Plaintiff
spontaneously offered:
I can do that. And again, I apologize. I'm embarrassed,
actually mortified, you know, by the circumstances. This
is a huge inconvenience to the Court, and I apologize to
Ms. Malone and Mr. Wyatt. I'm really not aware of what's
going on with Mr. Radbil. I didn't—you know, I didn't dial
a lawyer. I contacted a student loan advice website and
—over a number of months, actually, and was referred to
this law firm. Everything seemed to be square. Everything
seemed to be legitimate. I'm not an attorney, but, you know,
they seemed to know what they were doing, and I'm sorry
that this has happened....62
The discussion on how to proceed without Radbil continued.
And the Court proceeded, as planned, still assuming Radbil
would appear, to grant RAB's Rule 50 motion as to the
TCPA claim which RAB and Radbil had argued the previous
afternoon.63 With jury arguments looming and the Court's
instructions set to be finalized, the Court advised Plaintiff that
he did not have to speak to RAB's counsel about possible
settlement but that it was entirely his choice. White was
advised by the Court to take some time to decide what he
wanted to do.64
Later, still waiting for Radbil, Plaintiff spontaneously offered
a comment as to Radbil's confusing argument the previous
day when he attempted to justify his non-disclosure of the
$45,000 in damages to the Court with three conflicting
excuses. White stated:

## Page 7

White v. Regional Adjustment Bureau, Inc., Not Reported in Fed. Supp. (2015)
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 7
*8  ... I apologize, it seems presumptuous for me—seems
like I'm acting like my own attorney, which I am not in
any way. But I felt like I should make a response to the
issue of sandbagging [by Radbil] yesterday with the claims.
I did quantify the damages. And they were not an abstract
sum for mental anguish [as urged by Radbil], they were real
financial damages that I suffered. I made sure Mr. Radbil
had that information. The [magistrate judge] ... recorded
it in the settlement conference, and I was led to believe it
would be submitted for this trial, which of course it wasn't.
So I apologize.”65
Radbil Appears Two Hours Late for Trial
9. The Court then adjourned briefly to allow Plaintiff and
RAB to discuss possible settlement as indications were that
Radbil had abandoned his client. The Court recessed at 9:15
am until 10:15 at which time Radbil appeared in court. 66 He
explained that he had suffered food poisoning that morning
but did not contact anyone because “there was nobody that
[he] could call.” 67 From the Court's viewpoint, Radbil's
appearance and demeanor that morning did not comport with
his story that he had been—just an hour or so earlier—so
stricken with food poisoning that he was unable to contact the
Court or his client.
After Radbill arrived, White indicated to the Court that—in
Radbill's absence—he had tentatively reached an agreement
with RAB. 68 RAB's counsel recited the terms of the
settlement on the record. Radbil, having none of it, insisted
on counseling his client.69 After talking to Radbil in private,
White stated he wished to continue with Radbil as his
lawyer.70 The Court adjourned as the parties agreed to discuss
settlement which apparently involved nothing more that
Radbil accusing RAB's counsel of misconduct in talking to his
client. In short, Radbil refused go forward with the settlement
agreement that Plaintiff had agreed to in his absence and
instead accused RAB's counsel of threatening White.71
More Warnings by the Court
The Court warned Radbil:
... Mr. Radbil, your behavior has been shocking. And I
have found it driven as we go through this by bad faith
and dishonest behavior. You didn't show up for trial this
morning after your poor, substandard behavior yesterday;
no word from you. As I said, I have no glimmer of belief
that you were sick, ... [Y]ou have shown up and you look
fine, and no one heard from you for two hours, including
your client. So don't you dare accuse defense counsel
of anything, when you brought on all of the chaos this
morning that caused the Court to ask, in my obligation, to
make sure things are being ethically conducted, to ask your
client if he heard from you, and, if not, what his position
was on this case. As far as I knew, you abandoned the
case.... We will take care, Mr. Radbil, of your conduct after
this case is over, and it will be serious.72
10. Next, the parties presented their jury arguments, the Court
read the jury instructions and the jury retired to deliberate at
4:25 pm on February 27, 2013 and then adjourned for the
day at 5:00 pm.73 The jury returned the next day at 8:30 am.
By 9:15 am they returned a verdict in favor of RAB on all
claims against them. As to those claims on which Plaintiff had
prevailed on summary judgment, the jury found that Plaintiff
should receive “$0” damages.74
*9  Before adjourning the trial, the Court notified Radbil:
Mr. Radbil, we will have a full sanctions hearing, not
only about your conduct and misrepresenting facts to the
Court over and over in this case and then falsely accusing
counsel, which are two of the most serious offenses that
you can make as before a tribunal, but also I am really
concerned that you are not capable or competent to be
representing clients in federal court. And so the hearing will
also bear upon your qualifications and whether or not you
should be prohibited from practicing in federal court based
upon the incompetence and, more importantly than that, the
dishonesty that you have displayed throughout this case.75
11. To sum up, Radbil's conduct at the pretrial and trial,
from the Court's first-hand observation, appeared to be
that of an arrogant, yet surprisingly short-on-experience
and unprepared representative for his client. He displayed
a woefully inadequate understanding of basic pretrial
procedures on such issues as timely designating witnesses,
the components of a proper opening statements and even the
need to provide marked exhibits to the Court and co-counsel.
More importantly, during trial, he elicited testimony (about
actual damages and counseling efforts from his client) that he
had never disclosed to RAB despite RAB's proper discovery
requests for the information. This unexpected testimony was
highly disconcerting to RAB, having gone to extensive efforts
to prepare for trial based on the discovery and disclosures it
received from Radbil.

By far the most egregious and disappointing aspect of Radbil's
trial conduct was his willingness to mislead the Court and
counsel. Indeed, as will be addressed in more detail in
the next sections, replete throughout the record, is example
after example of Radbil's seemingly ingrained practice of
prevarication and misrepresentation. It was this practice
that tainted the entire trial and obstructed the truth-seeking
function of the Court.
As mentioned above, RAB filed its sanctions motions shortly
after trial. A hearing on the motions was convened on August
2, 2013.
Sanctions Hearings
August 2, 2013 Hearing
12. At the August 2, 2013 hearing on the sanctions motions,
attorneys Malone and Martin appeared on behalf of RAB.
Noah Radbil was represented by Marshall Meyers, a partner
in the Weisburg firm. Meyers also appeared on behalf of the
Weisburg firm.76
13. Malone, in her opening statement explained that her
motions for sanctions were based, inter alia , on Radbil's
misrepresentations and attempted “sandbagging” of RAB
during trial with the previously undisclosed $5000 and
$40,000 in damages.77 She further stated that she was basing
her request for sanctions on Radbil's deception to RAB
and the Court regarding Plaintiff' counseling efforts. 78 She
argued that Radbil's overall refusal to cooperate during the
entirety of the proceedings caused RAB multiple extra hours
of work. 79 These extra efforts, she maintained, included
attempting to prepare and defend a case in which they were
lied to, given incomplete and/or incorrect information and
were forced to review numerous documents. All of this,
Malone complains, was required to establish to the Court that
numerous representations by Radbil to the Court and counsel
were flatly contradicted by the record.80 As a side note, much
of the complained-of conduct occurred in the Court's presence
or was evident to the Court by virtue of Radbil's behavior
during the proceedings.
*10  14. Meyers spoke next. Much to the Court's dismay, he
adopted an unexpectedly defiant tone, most of which failed
to address the accusations in RAB's sanctions motions or
Malone's argument. Instead, Meyers touted his confidence
in his and his firm's integrity. He refused to concede that
Radbil engaged in any misconduct—save failing to appear
in court on the day of jury argument. In short, by refusing
to acknowledge the undeniable shortcomings in Radbil's
representation of Plaintiff, he lost credibility with the Court
as soon as he began speaking and things only got worse from
there. In short, Meyers adopted the same evasive refusal to
answer direct questions or concede facts that were clearly
established by the record that characterized Radbil's approach
to the case. A sampling from Meyers' opening comments:
It's exceptionally difficult, Judge, to sit and listen to
what Ms. Malone said. I am here, Your Honor, to take
responsibility for anything that my firm did, and Mr. Radbil
is part of my firm. Ms. Malone certainly uses a lot of words,
but I see them, Your Honor , as really naked allegations.
There are clearly some things—and obviously Mr. Radbil
being late to trial, there is no excuse for that, there is no
response to that, and we deserve whatever penalty the Court
imposes. To suggest that Mr. Radbil is a liar really hurts
me, Your Honor, because I know Noah and have worked
with him for a long time. I'm here to listen, like the Court
is, to the evidence and see if I'm mistaken. But everything
I know about Noah runs contradictory to what Ms. Malone
says. When we talk about the Rule 37 motion, Your Honor,
I think we laid out in our response point by point to every
allegation that Ms. Malone made how she was mistaken as
to what occurred. And I believe in the 1927 motion we did
the same, Your ... But I've obviously got to touch on some
of these issues to show the difference between us being
wrong as a matter of fact or law in the Court's view versus
us engaging in behavior that deserves sanctions. And I can't
talk about one without crossing into the other, but I want to
be clear. I'm not asking the Court to reconsider anything.81
...
It is obviously imperative to me as a person, not as a lawyer
but as a person, that I do things the right way and my firm
does things the right way. And to suggest I am manipulating
consumers is really a very tough pill to swallow.82
...
I'm here, Your Honor, to—to learn from the Court what
we could have done differently, what we could have done
better. And I'm here to explain, Your Honor, that no matter
how it is casted,(sic) it is not who I am as a lawyer, as a
business person, as a human being, to be the terrible person
that Ms. Malone makes me out to be. I am very selective
in the cases I bring and in the clients I accept, Your Honor.

## Page 9

And certainly it's the practice of law, and I've got to get
better at it, and I believe that I will get better every day
until I obviously stop working, Your Honor. But at the end
of the day, Your Honor, I think—I would—very clear on
being late to trial, no question, sanctions. A little less clear
on what exactly it was that we did during the case that is
worthy of sanctions.  And I would like obviously to hear
specifically and be able to present the Court evidence.83
15. Toward the close of Meyers' opening remarks, the Court
asked Meyers whether, in preparing for the hearing, he had
spoken to Plaintiff White about the allegations by RAB
against Radbil. Meyers responded; “... I have not [spoken
to White].” The Court, taken aback that Meyers had not
approached his firm's client under the circumstances, then
inquired: “So you've got ... these motions for sanctions, you've
got a highly unusual situation with one of your attorneys ...,
and you haven't talked to the client about what happened?”84
Meyers responded:
*11  You know, I haven't, Your Honor. I haven't. And it
was a decision that I did not want to bring up anything to Dr.
White that would, you know, rehash anything that was bad
that occurred, Your Honor. And because I was not there, I
really didn't want to get a skewed vision of what happened.
I wanted my understanding to be based on the transcript,
itself, because that would seem to be the strongest indicator
of what happened.85
Meyers then stated that “this has been a very difficult, difficult
thing for me to get my head around.” 86 Shortly after this
discussion, the testimony began with Malone calling Radbil
as her first witness.
Radbil's Testimony
16. Rather than recount Radbil's lengthy sanctions hearing
testimony in full, the Court will review the key points. 87
First, as an overview, Radbill's testimony at the hearing was
fraught with the same defiant, frustratingly obtuse manner
of answering questions that mirrored his approach at trial. 88
As will be seen below, Radbil's description of many events
was illogical and in many respects contradicted by the record
including by his own prior statements. It also required the
Court, on countless occasions, to call on RAB to research
its records, the court records and the transcripts in order to
respond to Radbil's numerous conflicting statements about
what had occurred in the case.
17. Radbill testified that he graduated from law school in 2009
and resides in Arizona.89 He testified (in a later hearing) that
in July 2012, after approximately 18 months of practice, he
was counsel of record in approximately 100 cases.90
18. Although Radbil claimed at the time of his testimony that
he had an actual—as opposed to ‘virtual’—office in Texas, his
official office address, at the time of the hearing, listed with
the State Bar of Texas is a post office box. Radbil denied this,
claiming to have updated the address, but when confronted
with the State Bar website information by RAB's, counsel, he
conceded the issue.91
Radbil Suspended from Practice
19. Radbil had been suspended from the practice of law during
a portion of the pendency of this case for failing to pay his
dues to the State Bar of Texas. Nonetheless, at the hearing, he
refused to admit he had been suspended. The now-standard,
extremely frustrating back and forth with him on this topic
is set out below. 92 Even Meyers, Radbil's lawyer, later told
the Court that Radbil should have admitted to the suspension
question.93
*12  20. Radbil was also asked about several incidents
that RAB considered misconduct on his part. One of those
issues was whether his firm had ever conveyed a reasonable
settlement demand to RAB. 94 After a frustratingly circular
response, Radbil finally admitted that the only post-filing
demand he gave RAB was for approximately $100,000.95
Unexpected $45, 000 in Actual Damages Testimony—Two
New Post-Trial Excuses
Background
21. Malone next questioned Radbil about the incident at
trial regarding the testimony by White about his $40,000
and $5000 in damages. As described above and for context
here, in Radbil's September 29, 2012 pretrial disclosures to
RAB, Radbil stated that Plaintiff's damages were limited to
$1500 in actual damages, reserving the right to supplement.96
As also described above, on January 18, 2013, just weeks
before trial, Radbil disclosed that Plaintiff's actual damages
—without citing any monetary figures—included any out-of-
pocket damages as well as damages for public humiliation,
embarrassment, mental anguish and emotional distress. 97
Later, at trial—for the first time, since the inception of

## Page 10

White v. Regional Adjustment Bureau, Inc., Not Reported in Fed. Supp. (2015)
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 10
the case—Plaintiff testified that he had incurred $40,000 in
excess fees due to RAB's refusal to work with him on a
repayment schedule. 98 White also testified that he lost an
additional $5000 due to RAB's activities causing him to
have to drop a teaching class. 99 RAB objected at trial to
the unexpected damages testimony. And, as described above,
after RAB's objected to the testimony, Radbil gave the Court
three different explanations as to how he had fulfilled his
pretrial disclosure obligations as to the damages figures.
First, he said that he had disclosed the damage figures.
Second, he claimed that the damages were disclosed but not
quantified. And, third, Radbil maintained that the $40,000 and
$5000 figures were based on emotional distress and mental
anguish and, therefore, did not need to be reduced to specific
amounts.100
*13  As discussed next, at the August 2, 2013 sanctions
hearing and in his sanctions briefing, Radbil came up with two
new reasons for his failure to disclose the $45,000. Neither of
these new excuses were mentioned by Radbil when the Court
questioned him at trial. Moreover, both of his new excuses
conflicted with his explanations to the Court during trial.101
New (Fourth) Excuse—Actual Damages Were Part of a
Confidential “Privileged” Settlement Memorandum and
Thus Could Not Be Disclosed
22. For context, as mentioned, during trial, RAB accused
Radbil of attempting to ambush it at trial with the $45,000
damages testimony by White. In support of its “ambush”
theory, in its Rule 37  Motion, filed shortly after trial,
RAB argued that Radbil's attorney billing records revealed
that Radbil, the day before pretrial disclosures were due
(December 7, 2012), had reviewed a memorandum from
White to Radbil on the topic of White's actual damages but
that this memorandum had never been disclosed to RAB
in violation of Fed. R. Civ. P. 37 .102 This, RAB argued in
its sanctions briefing, proved that Radbil had intended to
“ambush” RAB at trial with undisclosed damages evidence
provided to Radbil before trial.103
Responding to this allegation, Radbil maintained in his
post-trial sanctions briefing that White's December 6, 2012
actual damages memorandum was received and reviewed by
him but not disclosed to RAB because it was a privileged
document. Nonetheless, Radbil insisted, RAB was well aware
of this privileged memorandum prior to trial—ostensibly,
from Radbil's attorney billing records in RAB's possession
—but that RAB never moved to compel. Radbil justified his
non-disclosure of the information in the memo as follows:
...
... The particular document in question is a memorandum
regarding actual damages that Dr. White's counsel
requested he draft in preparation for trial. See Doc. 119
at 5. Dr. White's counsel was not required to provide Dr.
White's actual damages memorandum to RAB under Fed.
R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(B) because Dr. White's actual damages
memorandum is privileged or protected from disclosure
under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3)(A)(i)-(ii)....
Having been prepared specifically at the request of his
counsel in preparation for trial, Dr. White's memorandum
regarding his actual damages  would not ordinarily be
discoverable absent RAB showing a substantial need for
the materials to prepare its case and an inability, without
undue hardship, to obtain substantially equivalent evidence
by other means. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3)(A)(i)-(ii) .
Dr. White's deposition provided such means. See App. 25
(White Dep. at 29:16-23) (estimating disputed amount of
debt owed to Texas Guaranteed at $40,000).
While Dr. White did not expressly claim that Dr. White's
actual damages memorandum was privileged and protected
as trial-preparation materials under Rule 26(b)(5) , RAB
admittedly received notice of the Dr. White's trial
preparation memorandum prior to trial. Doc. 119 at 5.
Having filed two prior motions to compel discovery ... one
denied as moot and the other on its merits, see sections I and
II, supra, RAB took no action to compel the memorandum's
production. Therefore, RAB necessarily failed to show any
substantial need for the memorandum or that it could not
obtain substantially equivalent evidence through its client,
Texas Guaranteed.104
*14  In other words, Radbil urges in his sanctions
briefing, that on December 6, 2012, he (Radbil) received a
“confidential” memorandum from White regarding White's
actual damages, which Radbil claims RAB was aware of
but, nonetheless, failed to move to compel, thus depriving
itself of the ability to view its contents. Thus according to
Radbil, it was RAB's own fault for not getting the information
Radbil possessed regarding White's actual damages that RAB
claimed it was entitled to. Radbil repeated this theory at the
sanctions hearing on August 2, 2013.105

But this made little sense under the circumstances. Despite
being inconsistent with his plethora of other excuses for
permitting the $40,000 and $5000 damage testimony by
White, Radbil wholly fails to explain how RAB had a
duty or even the ability to glean from Radbil's cryptically
worded billing statements106 that they contained White's hard
damages figures. Moreover, Radbil fails to address how or
why RAB would even suspect that it needed to move to
compel this memorandum from the billing statements when
all indications from Radbil to RAB during the entirety of
formal discovery and pretrial phases of the case were that
White had no more than $1500 in actual damages.107
The Fifth Excuse for the $45,000 Undisclosed Damage
Testimony at Trial—“Rogue Response” by White.
23. Further undermining Radbil's steadily faltering credibility
was, again, during the August 2, 2013 hearing when he came
up with yet a fifth theory for not turning over the $45,000
figure to RAB. Specifically, Radbil, during his August 6,
2013 testimony, for the first time since White's trial testimony,
stated (in response to a question by Meyers), that the $40,000
and $5000 damages figures came out as a complete surprise
to Radbil, a sort of “rogue” response by White.108
But, this newly added “rogue client” theory was as dubious as
the others for several reasons. For one, Radbil had vigorously
defended the admission of the $45,000 during trial. Even
when he stated that the $45,000 constituted unquantifiable
mental anguish damages, never did he say at trial that the
$40,000 and $5000 figures did not belong in the case or were
erroneously interjected into the case by him or by a “rogue”
client. And not once did Radbil allude to this “rogue client”
theory in his sanctions briefing.
Undisclosed Counseling Efforts
24. Next, Malone questioned Radbil regarding RAB's
contention that Radbil tried to offer undisclosed testimony
about Plaintiff's efforts to undergo counseling. 109 As
recounted above, during the trial, Radbil asked Plaintiff
whether he had sought counseling due to RAB's debt
collection activities, RAB objected, prompting the Court to
call a side-bar conference. At the side-bar conference, Radbil
strangely told the Court that he did not know what Plaintiff's
response to the counseling question would be. 110 And then,
after a question by the Court, Radbil said he assumed the
answer would be favorable.
At the sanctions hearing, however, Radbil did an about-
face, now insisting that Plaintiff had sought counseling
prior to trial. 111 Radbil also maintained—in his responsive
briefing to the sanctions motions—that Plaintiff had disclosed
both in his interrogatory responses and in “extensive”
deposition testimony that he had received counseling.112 But,
as explained in RAB's Reply to Radbil's Response to RAB's
Rule 37  Motion, none of this is true. As described below,
nothing in the record supports Radbil's assertion that Plaintiff
either sought counseling or disclosed any counseling efforts
before trial.
*15  In its Reply and at the sanctions hearing on the
counseling issue, RAB points to pretrial deposition questions
by its counsel asking White whether he undertook any
counseling efforts (resulting from RAB's debt collection
activities). White answered that he had not talked to
his doctor or any other healthcare provider about RAB's
debt collection activity. 113 RAB further points to White's
deposition testimony that he had never discussed his panic
attacks with any healthcare provider other than Dr. Cush,
his rheumatologist. 114 RAB also notes that White testified
at his deposition that he had not sought counseling from Dr.
Cush or any other psychologist or psychiatrist.115 As further
evidence that Radbil had not disclosed White's counseling
efforts prior to trial, RAB refers to an interrogatory asking
White the following question:
INTERROGATORY NO. 23: If you likely will require
medical and/or psychiatric treatment in the future with
respect to the symptoms of stress and/or mental anguish
alleged in Plaintiff's Original Petition, state the name and
address of each person who has advised you that you will
likely require medical and/or psychiatric treatment in the
future, the treatment you will likely receive, the date such
treatment will likely be received, and the cost of such future
medical and/or psychiatric treatment.
To which White answered:
ANSWER: None. Plaintiff hereby expressly reserves the
right to supplement this response throughout the continuing
course of discovery
In the face of this undeniable evidence, Radbil's assertions
that White sought counseling and that it was, therefore, an
appropriate area of inquiry at trial is flatly false.
Undisclosed Witnesses

25. Next up at the August 2, 2013 hearing was the
topic of RAB's complaint about Radbil's attempt to offer
undisclosed witnesses at trial. 116 Specifically, on December
7, 2012, Radbil supplemented his pretrial disclosures with
nine previously undisclosed witnesses. 117 On January 18,
2013, a few weeks before trial, Radbil again supplemented
his pretrial disclosures with additional witnesses, five of
whom had not previously been disclosed, four of those
who appeared to be expert witnesses.118 Radbil had not
designated expert witnesses at anytime earlier in the case.
That Radbil might be attempting to add undisclosed experts
in the case at the eleventh hour, prompted RAB to prepare
and file motions to strike.119 Then, as set forth above, Radbil
filed two contradictory responses to RAB's motions to strike
the undisclosed experts. In his first response, Radbil denied
that any experts would testify. Later, on the heels of denying
experts would testify, he filed another document with the
Court, stating that, in fact, “one” of his witnesses would
provide expert testimony.120
After the trial, in response to RAB's Rule 37  Motion for
Sanctions regarding this issue, Radbil stated that he never
intended to offer expert testimony and that the expert dispute
had been resolved by the parties at the PTC and essentially
was a dead issue.121 Yet, he fails in his sanctions briefing to
address the inconsistency in his responses to the motions to
strike. That is, until the August 2, 2013 sanctions hearing,
where Radbil—for the first time—offered a new explanation
for his inconsistent responses; that being that the statement
that “one” of his witnesses would provide expert testimony,
was simply a typo that should have said “ none” instead of
“one.”122 This new version of events is questionable for
several reasons, not the least of which is Radbil's own billing
records, dated September 21, 2012, indicating that Radbil
notified his “expert” of the trial date.123 Specifically, Malone
asked Radbil about one of his billing records with the entry
“... prepare letter to expert re[:] date for trial....”124
*16  The fact that no experts were ultimately called by Radbil
at trial is of no moment to the sanctions analysis, because the
point of recounting this incident is that it provides yet another
in a mounting series of incidents demonstrating Radbil's
substandard lawyering in this case and, more importantly,
his persistent pattern of ‘moving target’ explanations for his
litigation tactics.
Plaintiff's No Show for the Verdict
26. Another point raised at the August 2, 2013 sanctions
hearing involved Plaintiff's failing to appear for the return
of the verdict at trial.125 Specifically, when the jury returned
their verdict on February 28, 2013, Plaintiff was not present.
When asked by the Court where he was, Radbil stated that he
was not there because he had to work. 126 Radbil then stated
“I let him know as soon as the verdict was in, and he was
going to head over here as soon as he could.” 127 The Court
directed Radbil to tell White that he was to appear in court
immediately.128 When Plaintiff arrived, he told the Court, “I
was advised by my attorney that I didn't have to be here.”129
The following conversation between the Court, Radbil and
Plaintiff ensued:
MR. RADBIL: ... Mr. White, didn't I advise you that you
should be here when the verdict came back?
DR. WHITE: You advised me that I did not need to be here;
it was not necessary.
MR. RADBIL: And did I advise you that you should be
here when the verdict came back this morning when we—
THE COURT: Just be honest, Dr. White.
DR. WHITE: A few minutes ago, yes.
THE COURT: But not before a few minutes ago.
DR. WHITE: Right.
THE COURT: Thank you. Mr. Radbil, once again I have
caught you in a less than candid assertion to the Court. But
we can take all that up when we have the hearing that we're
going to have regarding your behavior in this case at a later
time. Dr. White, you are free to go. Thank you.130
At a later hearing, Radbil produced an e-mail exchange
between himself and White, purportedly at the time
the verdict was returned—albeit, reflecting an hour's
difference in time from the time the actual verdict was
returned.131 The e-mail contains an exchange between
Radbill and White the morning the verdict was returned
showing Radbil telling White to come to court when the
verdict was returned.132 That said, the introduction of this
exhibit does not clarify why, in the presence of the Court the
morning of the verdict, White and Radbil gave conflicting

## Page 13

White v. Regional Adjustment Bureau, Inc., Not Reported in Fed. Supp. (2015)

accounts of why White was not present in court for the
verdict.
More Warnings to Radbil
27. At the close of the August 2, 2013 (full day) sanctions
hearing, the Court made the following statement to the parties:
THE COURT: (Speaking to Radbil) ... [My] concern is that
I'm not seeing any indication from you today, other than
the fact that you were late to court, that you did anything
wrong. Is that what your position is, that you are right and
they are just nitpicking?
RADBIL: No, Your Honor. My position is that I didn't do
anything—
THE COURT: Speak up, please.
THE WITNESS: My position is that nothing was done in
bad faith; nothing was done intentionally or vexatiously....
...
THE COURT: What I am seeing is an overwhelming record
of misrepresentations and misconduct and not being honest
with the Court about one thing after another after another....
And what at least I was hoping to hear from you today was
that you recognized that and are sorry, and I don't see that.
And I [also] don't see that from you, Mr. Meyers, except
for a little bit more of a concession that his behavior was
unacceptable....133
*17  ...
I would like to move ahead and see whatever else we have. I
would like to hear a little bit more specific on the attorney's
fees and the nexus or causation therefore, the conduct and
the attorney's fees. But otherwise, you can step down, Mr.
Radbil, going to move ahead....134
After some discussion with the lawyers the Court concluded
the proceedings for the day and scheduled a second
hearing for the following week, August 7, 2013. Before
adjourning, the Court notified Meyers of his potential
personal responsibility for bad faith conduct, stating:
THE COURT: Here is what my thoughts are at this point....
This is a very, very serious type of hearing, conduct that is
completely unacceptable not only professionally towards
opposing counsel.... [T]he Court had [a] firsthand view of
the anguish that this behavior caused the client when he was
left here for two hours with no word from counsel. We need
to finish this. And we need to make sure that the record
is clear before the ultimate decision and responsibility
is determined.... [W]ith ... [Malone's] position that Mr.
Meyers should be called to testify for his responsibility
and that of the firm, I think that may be appropriate, but I
don't think it's appropriate today because, as far as I know,
he hasn't been placed on notice that he might be subject
to that kind of sanction. And when you are talking about
potential bad faith conduct—and I want to be sure I'm clear,
the Court is also going to rely here on its inherent authority
—then I think Mr. Meyers needs to have a chance to find
counsel and speak on his own behalf and on behalf of his
firm.135
The case was adjourned until August 7, 2013.
August 7, 2013 Sanctions Hearing
28. Instead of proceeding on August 7, 2013, Meyers moved
to continue the sanctions hearing for 30 days, his filing
accompanied by numerous documents not previously noticed
as exhibits.136
The Court rejected Meyer's attempt to offer the new
documents at that time but granted his motion for continuance
to further prepare and organize his new exhibits, given
Malone's intent to call him as a witness. 137 An Order was
entered resetting the hearing for October 9, 2013 and directing
the parties to prepare and exchange exhibits they planned to
offer that were not already part of the record.138
October 9, 2013 Sanctions Hearing
29. At the October 9, 2013 hearing, Malone and Martin
appeared again for RAB. Meyers appeared on his own behalf
and on behalf of the Weisberg firm. New to the case, attorneys
Dale Jefferson and Raul Suazo made their first appearance
on behalf of Radbil. The Court commenced the hearing by
clarifying the record as to the admitted exhibits. 139 The
testimony then began with Malone calling Meyers to the
witness stand.
*18  30. The thrust of Malone's questioning of Meyers was
to establish—and she did—that, although Meyers and other
members of the Weisburg firm were aware of a litany of
ethical and tactical missteps by Radbil in the course of his
work as an attorney for their law firm, they nonetheless
publicly promoted him as a key member of their firm for

the state of Texas. 140 For example, Meyers admitted that
the firm's website—up until a few weeks before the October
9th hearing—listed Radbil as their “managing attorney” for
Texas.141 This, despite the fact that Meyers—as he testified—
had never seen Radbil perform in a formal hearing or trial and
Meyers' concession at the sanctions hearing that he was not
sure that he would recommend Radbil's services to others.142
31. Malone also asked Meyers about a case, of which Meyers
was well aware and in which Meyers had some first-hand
involvement. The case was pending (at that time) in the
Southern District of Texas and was styled Scarlott v. Nissan
North America, Inc., et al. , No. 4:10-CV-4865, in which
defendant Nissan North America, Inc (“Nissan”) sought
sanctions against plaintiff's counsel, Noah Radbill,143 Aaron
Radbil, and Dennis Kurz. 144 Nissan's thirty-page motion
for sanctions, filed October 31, 2011, accused the three
attorneys of violating Rule 11 Fed. R. Civ. P . as well as
transgressing numerous ethical codes, including the Texas
Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct and the Texas
Lawyer's Creed.145 Reduced to its essence, the crux of the
conduct complained of by Nissan was that Noah Radbil and
co-counsel lied in their pleadings numerous times to sustain
an untenable legal case against Nissan. 146 The presiding
judge, in his order granting the defendants' motions for
summary judgment entered on August 28, 2013, directed
that the Plaintiff “take nothing” from Nissan “because her
claims are not supported by facts or law.” 147 The court then
invited the prevailing defendants to “request fees, sanctions,
or both.”148
On September 27, 2013, Nissan filed an amended motion
for sanctions. 149 A hearing was held on Nissan's and its
co-defendant's motions for sanctions on October 10, 2013.
The transcript of the hearing shows that the district court
spent the bulk of the hearing chastising Noah Radbil for his
“abysmal judgment and performance” in the case. 150 The
court granted Nissan's sanctions motions, ordering $195,000
be paid by Radbil and his firm to Nissan, specifically calling
out Radbil and his firm for their “unconscionable”151 conduct
in pursuing Nissan in the case and describing Noah Radbil
and his firm as “unprincipled.”152
*19  32. Malone also questioned Meyers about an in-
court filing by Radbil in an unrelated case which Malone
suggested showed that Radbil lacked a basic understanding of
fundamental jury selection principles. Specifically, in 2011,
Radbil had filed a motion for new trial in the 48 th Judicial
District Court for Tarrant County, Texas. In his motion, Radbil
argued that the state trial court had erred in allowing the
attorneys to move to strike certain venire panel members for
cause before permitting them to exercise their peremptory
strikes.153 When confronted with this tactical misstep by
Radbil during the sanctions hearing, after a frustrating attempt
to get a straight answer from him, Meyers conceded Radbil's
error.154
33. Malone also asked Meyers about other incidents of
troubling conduct by Radbil in particular as well as by other
partners in the Weisburg firm in unrelated cases. 155 She
produced numerous exhibits, including motions, orders and
judgments from various cases suggesting that Radbil and/or
the Weisburg firm had been involved in questionable conduct
in other cases.156
*20  34. Malone referred Meyers to an order issued April
26, 2011 by a federal judge in the Southern District of Texas
describing Noah Radbil, who was plaintiff's counsel in the
case, of “petty gamesmanship” for making a “disingenuous
technical argument” that the defendant had improperly served
its Rule 68 offer of judgment on plaintiff in the case by
facsimile and email.157 The court further warned Radbil that
the court would “not permit” such tactics in the future. 158
Meyers acknowledged the order and its contents. 159 Meyers
also did not dispute that after this admonishment for “petty
gamesmanship,” Radbil repeated the identical argument
against RAB in a case pending in the Northern District of
Texas.160
35. Malone also established that Radbil, along with two other
attorneys, was the subject of a show cause order in 2011
by a federal judge in the Western District of Washington
for making “misrepresentations” to that court regarding his
eligibility to practice law in that court.161
36. Malone also asked Meyers about the Weisburg law firm's
public website which, at least up until a week before the
October 9th sanctions hearing, contained false and misleading
information about Radbil and other members of the firm. 162
Among numerous misstatements about Radbil, conceded by
Meyers, contained on the firm's website, was an entry under
“Notable Trial Victories” indicating that Radbil had secured

## Page 15

White v. Regional Adjustment Bureau, Inc., Not Reported in Fed. Supp. (2015)
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 15
a victory for a plaintiff named Shannon Whaley, in a 2012
Dallas County debt collection action. 163 In fact, as Meyers
conceded at the hearing, and as the final judgment in the case
reflects, Radbil lost that case when the jury returned a verdict
of $92,000 against his client. 164 Meyers also conceded that
the firm sent out a false press release indicating that Radbil
had won the Whaley case.165
37. Another of several questionable postings on the firm's
website, which was sponsored and controlled by Meyers
and called “Attorneys for Consumers,” 166 hailed Radbil as
counsel in “the first RIAA music-downloading case to go
to trial in the United States.” 167 In fact as Malone pointed
out, the actual court website for that entry shows the case
going to trial two years before Radbil was even licensed as
an attorney.168 Meyers indicated that he knew “nothing about
that case” but conceded that he had, nonetheless, permitted
it on the firm website without checking the validity of the
posting.169 The website also notes that Radbil represented
“several authors” in a copyright-infringement case against
“Scribd,” which, according to Malone and not disputed by
Meyers, also concluded before Radbil was licenced. 170 The
website lists Radbill as being among a group of lawyers
representing a group of NCAA athletes in a class-action
against the NCAA when, in fact, the official court record does
not even list Radbil as counsel of record.171 Radbil made no
attempt at the hearing to refute Malone's challenges to the
questionable website postings about his experience.172
*21  38. Malone also questioned Meyers about several
instances where members of his firm—other than Radbil—
had been sanctioned by courts for misconduct. 173 Meyers
did not dispute that these incidents had occurred, despite
the fact that prior to the October 9, 2013 hearing, he filed
a sworn affidavit with the Court swearing under oath that
“no attorney in his firm ha[d] ... ever been disciplined.” 174
Those sanctions included a 2011 order by a federal judge in
Colorado against Meyers' partner at the time, Craig Erlich,
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1927 for “proceeding to trial without
plausible evidence to support the claim made.”175 That ruling
was affirmed by the Tenth Circuit.176
39. Another sanctions order, this one in 2011, was entered
against founding partner, Alex D. Weisburg and the Weisburg
firm by a Florida state court for filing “baseless” grievances
against four attorneys involved in a case in that court.177 The
Florida court found Weisburg's conduct to be “unjustified,
vicious, willful and malicious.” 178 In another case out of
federal court in Florida in 2013, again involving founding
partner, Alex D. Weisburg, who was also directly involved in
the instant case, the court sanctioned Weisburg under § 1927
for “knowingly and recklessly pursu[ing] claims ... which
clearly would have been foreclosed.”179
40. Meyers himself was the subject of scorn by a federal judge
in the Eastern District of New York who noted the court's
“serious concern” that the lawsuit filed by Meyers, pending
in his court was “an attempt by plaintiff and/or his attorneys
to manipulate the law for an improper purpose.”180 Although
the firm was not ultimately sanctioned, that judge also noted
“other circumstantial evidence suggesting bad faith” and
raised his concern that “plaintiff is a repeat filer of FDCPA
lawsuits, and he is represented by the same attorneys in those
lawsuits.”181 The court also questioned whether plaintiff's
attorneys in that case had acted in “good faith” in advancing
their arguments.182
41. After Malone finished her questioning of Meyers, Meyers,
testifying on his own behalf, launched into a redundant,
platitude-filled defense of his law firm, which for the most
part did not relate to the specifics alleged against the firm
in this case or to the foregoing instances of misconduct by
Radbil and the firm in other cases. 183 When pressed by
the Court, Meyers insisted that he had “never received a
complaint about Noah [Radbil] from opposing counsel.” 184
This statement, however, was directly contradicted by,
inter alia , Nissan's 2011 and 2013 motions for sanctions,
addressed above and pending at the time Meyers made this
statement185 accusing Radbil of numerous, serious ethical
transgressions. Moreover, at the time of his statement to
this Court, Meyers(although he did not disclose it to the
Court) was scheduled to appear the next day—with Radbil—
in the Houston federal court presiding over Nissan's sanctions
motions.186
*22  42. Meyers also told the Court at the October 9, 2013
hearing that he and Radbil no longer worked together even
though, as mentioned, Meyers was scheduled to, and did,
appear with Radbil the day after the October 9th hearing at the
Houston federal court sanctions hearing.187 When questioned
at the subsequent November 6, 2013 sanctions hearing about
his presence at the Houston federal court sanctions hearing,
Meyers conceded that he had appeared at the hearing with

## Page 16

White v. Regional Adjustment Bureau, Inc., Not Reported in Fed. Supp. (2015)
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 16
Radbil on October 9, 2013, but for some reason insisted that
Noah Radbil did not take the lead in defending the sanctions
motion.188 Meyers stated that, not only did Noah Radbil not
take the lead in the sanctions hearing for the firm, Radbil only
spoke at the request of the judge who, according to Meyers,
entreated at one point: “I want to hear from Noah Radbil.”189
But Meyers' description of what happened at the Houston
federal court hearing is not supported by the transcript of
the hearing. The transcript unmistakably shows Noah Radbil
firmly taking the lead at the hearing. The transcript showing
him speaking—not at the judge's request, but on his own
initiative—as the primary, if not sole, advocate for the firm as
reflected on pages 19 through 93 of the 94-page transcript.190
Although Meyers had insisted that Radbil did not take the
lead at the Houston hearing, when asked by this Court about
the specifics of the accusations against Radbil at the Houston
hearing, Meyers professed a lack of memory stating to the
Court that he did not remember the specifics of the allegations
against Radbil by Nissan.191
43. To sum up, the foregoing litany of questionable incidents
involving Radbil, Meyers and other members of their firm
presented by RAB constituted credible evidence in this
Court's view of a firm with no ethical oversight, run
amok. First, Radbil and Meyers mounted negligible, if
any, opposition to the evidence of Radbil's and the firm's
ethical run-ins with other courts or to the evidence of
the dubious website postings about Radbil's experience as
a lawyer for the NCAA, a major league baseball player
and the like. When Meyers did speak up to describe the
Houston federal court sanctions hearing at the November
6, 2013 hearing, his rendition of Radbil's role was flatly
wrong based on the record. Ultimately, the credible proof at
the October 9, 2013 sanctions hearing, established Radbil's
and the firm's willingness—if not propensity—to engage in
questionable litigation tactics. Not only that, the evidence
demonstrated both Radbil's and Meyers' willingness to
fabricate information about Radbil's and the firm's litigation
experience as posted on the firm's public website. Finally,
and most importantly, Meyers' refusal to concede Radbil's
undeniably substandard practices at trial coupled with the fact
that Meyers, himself, employed an almost identical pattern of
evasion and prevarication in the sanctions hearings, doomed
Meyers' and Radbil's credibility and strongly implicated
Meyers' complicity in Radbil's bad faith conduct.
44. The presentation of the evidence was not completed at
the close of the October 9, 2013, sanctions hearing. Radbil's
attorney represented to the Court that he intended to recall
Radbil to the witness stand and Malone indicated that she,
likewise, had additional evidence to present. 192 Thus a third
full sanctions hearing was scheduled for November 6, 2013.
November 6, 2013 Sanctions Hearing
More False Public Website Postings
45. Malone's first witness called at the third full hearing
on RAB's motions for sanctions was Martin, Malone's co-
counsel in the case. Martin was a credible witness. Martin
testified that he had located a Twitter account belonging to
Meyers that, on July 25, 2013—five months after Radbil
lost White's case—that indicated that the Weisburg firm
had prevailed in White's case and that White was entitled
to significant damages. 193 This information was posted by
Meyers despite the fact that at the time of this posting, July
25, 2013, the jury's verdict in this case, returned in February
2013, and the Court's judgment that followed in March 2013
unequivocally stated that Radbil lost the case and that White
“take nothing by his suit” against RAB.194
$45,000 Damages—Surprise Sworn Declaration from White
in absentia
*23  46. Also at the November 6, 2013 hearing, during
Martin's testimony, Meyers produced—for the first time in
court—an affidavit that purported to be a “Declaration of
Timothy White,” dated October 2, 2013, obtained some seven
months after the trial and just days before the October 9,
2013 sanctions hearing.195 Interestingly, this late-filed entry
into the sanctions exhibit mix, produced by Meyers during
his cross-examination of Martin, 196 was by Meyers' own
admission, partially drafted by Meyers, who then forwarded
it to Radbil and Jefferson. 197 More importantly, there is no
indication from the record that White himself played any
role in contributing to the contents of his own Declaration.
Attached to the Declaration were several e-mails as well as a
letter purportedly written by White to Radbil, dated December
28, 2012, in which White recited a summary of his damages,
none of which contained any of out-of pocket figures. 198
Missing were the $45,000 in out-of-pocket damages that
White had testified about at trial. In his Declaration, and at
odds with his statements to the Court at trial, White averred
that neither Radbil nor Meyers ever counseled or advised

White to seek specific “out-of-pocket” losses in his testimony
to the jury.199
White's Declaration and attached letter were suspect, to say
the least, given White's absence for the entirety of the five
sanctions hearings200 and considering the fact that much of
the Declaration's contents and those of the attached letter
sharply conflicted with White's trial testimony that he had
incurred $45,000 in economic damages and his insistence
to the Court during trial that he had quantified his damages
for Radbil who told him the figures would be submitted
at trial. 201 Further detracting from the evidentiary value
of the Declaration and its attachments was the statement
of Jefferson, Radbil's attorney, to the Court that “Meyers”
had actually “put together” the “affidavit” for White's
signature.202 Meyer's himself told the Court he prepared
paragraphs 1-5 and 11 of the affidavit and then forwarded it
to Radbil and Jefferson. 203 Jefferson said the affidavit was
later—through Jefferson's office—transmitted to a “mobile
notary service” that, in turn, transported it to White's
home where White purportedly signed the affidavit. 204 In
essence, all of this suggesting that, after the August 2,
2013 sanctions hearing, White agreed to sign a notarized
statement, prepared by the lawyers, that sharply conflicted
with his statements to the Court during the trial and his
testimony to the jury. Moreover, White's December 28, 2012
letter—if true—could have bolstered Radbil's theory that he
never intended to seek out-of-pocket damages; not once was
the letter mentioned or even alluded to by Radbil during
trial, in his Response to the sanctions motions (in which
he addressed White's confidential settlement memorandum
regarding actual damages) or at the August 2, 2013 sanctions
hearing.
Equally curious was that the exhibit appeared at all in the
sanctions proceedings. This, in that the Declaration was
prepared and procured to a large extent by Meyers who
had firmly told the Court at the initial sanctions hearing, on
August 2, 2013, that he had not approached or spoken to
White at all about the problems that occurred during trial
which were now causing Meyers, Radbil and the Weisburg
firm to face potentially devastating sanctions. Specifically,
when asked by the Court if he had spoken to White, his firm's
only client in the case, Meyers said:
*24  You know, I haven't, Your Honor. I haven't [spoken
to White]. And it was a decision that I did not want to bring
up anything to Dr. White that would, you know, rehash
anything that was bad that occurred, Your Honor. And
because I was not there, I really didn't want to get a skewed
vision of what happened. I wanted my understanding to be
based on the transcript, itself, because that would seem to
be the strongest indicator of what happened.205
Apparently Meyers had a change of heart in deciding
not only to contact White but also to draft a portion of
White's Declaration which deviated materially from “the
[trial] transcript itself” which Meyers initially described as the
“strongest indicator of what happened.” Equally questionable
about the “Declaration of Timothy White” is its material
departure from White's statements to the Court during the trial
on the morning that Radbil failed to appear insisting he had
given Radbil “his real financial damages” and was assured by
Radbil the figures would be presented at trial. 206 Whereas,
the about-face in his Declaration averred:
9. At no time ever did Noah Radbil, Marshall Myers or
anyone at Weisburg and Meyers coach me, advise me, or
otherwise tell me to tell the jury a specific dollar figure
for damages. To the contrary, Noah always said leave it
up to the jury alone to arrive at a specific figure for actual
damages....207
Malone Testifies
47. Also at the November 6, 2013 hearing, Malone testified,
called by her co-counsel, Martin. Among other topics, she
testified about her interactions with Radbil and the Weisburg
firm. She described her frustration when Radbil failed to
return her “10 calls and e-mails” the weekend before trial
as directed by the Court. 208 She said her observation of
Radbil in this and other cases she had with him was that
he lacks fundamental knowledge of trial basics. 209 She said
that Radbil lied to this Court during trial and the sanctions
hearings and also lied about prior representations of high
profile clients on his website. 210 She said that in another
case she had with Radbil, she caught him reviewing her
trial notebook after she returned to the courtroom from the
restroom.211 Malone was a highly credible witness.
Radbil Testifies Again: $45,000—Another Version—More
Inconsistencies
48. Radbil testified at the proceedings on November 6,
2013, this time called by his counsel, Raul Suazo. Suazo,
on Radbil's behalf, first argued that it was Malone, not

## Page 18

White v. Regional Adjustment Bureau, Inc., Not Reported in Fed. Supp. (2015)
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 18
Radbil, who prompted the questions about damages. 212 But
this is disingenuous—in that it was Radbil who prompted
the inquiry with the question “what is the current status
of your student loan” to which Malone—surprised by
the unexpected introduction of undisclosed actual damages
evidence—logically followed up later with a question asking
if there was anything else by way of damages that had not
been disclosed, prompting the $5000 figure.213
49. During his November 6, 2013 testimony, Radbil, for the
first time stated that the $45,000 was not “mental anguish”
damages at all but was (all along) simple “economic”
damages which Radbil never intended to seek in the first place
because they were solely attributable to Texas Guaranteed,
not to RAB.214
*25  This latest attempt by Radbil to distance himself from
the undisclosed $45,000 evidence fell flat. First, and most
obvious was that this was yet another in a series of entirely
inconsistent excuses for the $45,000. Second, nowhere in his
statements to the Court during the trial or in his sanctions
briefing or at any other time had Radbil ever mentioned that
the $45.000 was attributable solely to Texas Guaranteed and
thus not sought by him at trial. 215 Radbil and Suazo argued
at the hearing that Radbil and White had discussed the fact
that Texas Guaranteed was solely responsible for the $45,000
in damages and that there were two pretrial memoranda
that supported this position. 216 But this is simply not true
upon examination of these documents. 217 In fact, as will
be addressed below, once the contents of the memorandum
were finally disclosed at the November 26, 2013 hearing,
it was clear that nothing in that memorandum remotely
suggests that White ever attributed the $40,000 solely to
Texas Guaranteed.218
The gist of the November 6, 2013 sanctions hearing was that
it was more of the same sleight-of-hand tactics by Radbil and
Meyers that marked all of the prior hearings. In fact, Meyers'
introduction of the lawyer-generated “Declaration” by White,
who, in absentia, months after the trial, contradicted his own
prior statements to the Court about the nature of his damages,
was suspect to say the least. Then Radbil's latest version
of conflicting explanations for the $45,000 damages snafu
—that it was all along “economic” damages—never sought
from RAB because the damages were caused solely by Texas
Guaranteed theory—was not only not believable, it smacked
of a “shell game”—and a poor one at that—perpetrated on the
Court.
After the close of the November 6, 2013 hearing, the Court
scheduled the fifth and final sanctions hearing on RAB's
motions for November 26, 2013.
November 26, 2013 Sanctions Hearing
50. The fifth and final sanctions hearing began with
a continuation of Radbil's testimony, which essentially
consisted of Radbil re-urging his theory that, he did nothing
wrong but, if he did, his actions were not taken in bad faith
and caused no prejudice to RAB.219
51. On cross-examination by Malone, Radbil testified that he
handled the bulk of the substantive work on White's case.220
He also agreed that his work on the case was reviewed by
Weisburg partners, Weisburg, Meyers, Ehrlich and Aaron
Radbil.221
52. Undoubtedly the most significant portion of the
November 26 th hearing was the seemingly inadvertent
disclosure of the actual contents of the December 6, 2012
“confidential settlement memorandum,” discussed above.
The memo contained White's written assessment of his actual
damages which he sent to Radbil the day before pretrial
disclosures were due. This“privileged” memorandum had
been addressed in the sanctions briefing and at the other
sanctions hearings. Most recently this memo was discussed at
the November 6, 2013 sanctions hearing by Malone when she
complained that, although the December 6, 2012 memo had
been cited by Radbil222 and Suazo as containing information
that supported Radbil's theory that he had not intended to
seek the $45,000 in damages, Radbil had never disclosed its
contents to RAB.223
Specifically, as Malone began to question Radbil about
his December 6, 2012 attorney billing records, 224 asking
him about the heretofore described “confidential” actual
damages memo from White dated December 6, 2012,
Suazo spontaneously offered; “... I have the actual memo
if it will speed it up.” 225 The sudden appearance of the
previously undisclosed memorandum's contents by Radbil's
counsel, from the Court's observation, appeared completely
unexpected by Radbil. In fact, Suazo thereafter attempted to
claim, despite having offered up the document, purportedly
only to establish the veracity of Radbil's billing records,
that the memo remained a privileged document. 226 Suazo

## Page 19

White v. Regional Adjustment Bureau, Inc., Not Reported in Fed. Supp. (2015)

further maintained that the memo was in most respects
the substantially similar to the December 28, 2012 memo
already in evidence as Radbil's sanctions hearing exhibit
34.227 Malone, who stated she had never seen the memo
before, strongly disputed Suazo's argument that the memo
was privileged or that it was “substantially similar” to
the December 28, 2012 memo. 228 The Court agreed with
Malone and, over Suazo and Radbil's objections, admitted the
December 6, 2012 memo as RAB-S Exh. 45.229
*26  The significance of the contents of the December 6,
2012 memo cannot be overstated. First, it stands in stark
contrast to White's already-questionable “Declaration” and
attached letter 230 dated December 28, 2012, produced by
Meyers at the November 6, 2013 hearing. 231 While that
Declaration and letter strongly indicated that hard figures
were never a viable part of White's and Radbil's pretrial
damages discussions, the December 6, 2012 memo confirms
the opposite, that White—as he insisted to the Court during
trial—did provide hard damages figures to Radbil, the day
before their pretrial disclosures were due to be filed in court.
Moreover, as pointed out by Malone once the contents of the
memo were disclosed,232 she observed that the language used
in White's December 6, 2012 memo to Radbil closely tracks
White's trial testimony about the $45,000 in damages.233 For
example, at trial Radbil specifically asked White: “Did the
fact that Regional Adjustment Bureau continued to call your
Simple Surrogacy employment telephone numbers after you
told them not to cause you to suffer actual damages?” 234
To this question, White responded: “Yes, it caused a domino
effect in my life that caused me to develop mental health
symptoms I had never experienced before. And it literally cost
me by adding exponentially to my debt and with some out-
of-pocket costs.”235 This is precisely the type of information
included in White's December 6, 2012 memo that Radbil, by
his question, solicited from White at trial and later insisted
was unplanned.236
Further, not only is the December 6, 2012 memo not
“substantially similar to White's December 28, 2012 letter,”
as urged by Suazo, it effectively contradicts what White wrote
in that letter and it renders White's purported October 2, 2013
“Declaration,” prepared by the lawyers, bereft of evidentiary
value. For example, the December 6, 2012 memorandum
includes among other hard damages figures, two $20,000
figures and one $5000 figure that White claimed as damages
caused by RAB.237 And, in complete contradiction to Radbil's
testimony at the November 6, 2013 hearing, the December 6,
2012 memo contains nothing to support Radbil's most recent
explanation that the $45,000 was attributable solely to Texas
Guaranteed. In fact at the top of the December 6, 2012 memo,
White states that he is describing his damages “ caused by
Regional Adjustment Bureau.”238
After Radbil's testimony, the evidence on the sanctions
motions was closed and the lawyers, Martin (for RAB),
Meyers (for himself and the firm) and Jefferson (for Radbil)
gave their closing remarks. Jefferson's comments, on behalf
on Radbil, repeated Radbil's theme that his missteps, if
any, were not intentional but “communication quirks by
Radbil.”239
Summary of Factual Findings
To sum up, three overall conclusions can be drawn from the
foregoing fifty-pages of factual findings. First, Radbil, despite
being heavily promoted by his firm as a legal talent, does
not possess the competence or integrity to represent clients
in federal court. Second, Radbil's firm, specifically, partner
Marshall Meyers, knows this, endorses Radbil's conduct and
models it himself. Third, Radbil and Meyers effected a fraud
on the Court through evasion, prevarication and outright
lies, in an attempt to avoid negative legal consequences
against them and their firm due to Radbil's unprofessional trial
conduct.
To understand what went so wrong in this case, it is helpful to
start with a description of what should have happened. Under
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a trial is designed,
beginning with the pretrial discovery process, to be a fair
and predictable exercise by the parties in presenting their
theory of a case to a judge or jury. 240 That means, in turn,
that the parties are entitled to notice of the other side's
evidence through the pretrial discovery process. The pretrial
process allows for broad discovery, tempered by court-
imposed deadlines with the goal of attaining streamlined and
cost-effective trial preparation by the parties culminating in a
trial with no surprises. The mutual exchange of information
through discovery also encourages the fair and cost-effective
resolution of disputes short of trial. That said, the very
integrity of the federal civil trial process hinges on the parties'
adherence to the foregoing principles and, most essentially,
upon the honesty and character of the attorneys involved.

*27  Here, the process failed miserably due to Radbil's and
later Myers' refusal to respect the process, follow the rules and
simply tell the truth. In a textbook example of what the Rules
are designed to avoid, RAB's counsel was unfairly forced
to fend off undisclosed evidence and misrepresentations by
Radbil at every turn during the trial. These tactics were both
distracting and costly to RAB as it attempted to defend its
case.
From the outset, Radbil's advocacy skills and overall
experience as a lawyer were of concern to the Court. Starting
at the pretrial phase, Radbil's late designation of witnesses241
followed by his inconsistent explanations for the untimely
designations were not in keeping with the actions of a
seasoned lawyer taking on the role of lead advocate for his
client at trial. Not only that, Radbil's seemingly inept tactics
were highly disconcerting to RAB as it attempted to prepare
for the trial just weeks away. So unsettling was Radbil's
naming of several unexpected witnesses to RAB in the weeks
before trial, that it filed two sets of objections to the witness
designations. Yet, due to Radbil's conflicting responses to
its objections, (first, no experts would testify then “one”
expert would testify), RAB was left in the dark as to Radbil's
intentions until the eve of trial. Only adding to RAB's distress,
as Malone recounted during the sanctions hearings, Radbil
refused to return her “ten” phone calls and “ten” e-mails the
Saturday before trial despite the Court's order that the parties
confer.
At trial, Radbil's unprofessional antics only worsened as did
its effects on RAB's ability to defend its case. First were
Radbil's attempts to introduce evidence to the jury about
never-before-disclosed counseling efforts by White. And then
came the surprise testimony by White that he had incurred
$45,000 in actual damages due to RAB's actions. As with
the untimely witness designations, this evidence (counseling
and $45,000 damages) was completely unexpected by RAB's
counsel and, at least temporarily, derailed their trial plan as
they had to search their files to support their objection to the
Court. But even recognizing these below-the-belt tactics as
such, a much more serious pattern of conduct on Radbil's part
emerged during the trial and in the sanctions hearings that
followed. That being Radbil's unabashed willingness to lie to
the Court to avoid negative consequences for his behavior.
Examples of this bad faith conduct abound in the fifty-pages
of factual findings. This troubling behavior came partly in
the form of Radbil's frustratingly evasive and circular non-
responses to simple questions about his conduct. For example,
as to the counseling evidence, Radbil firmly told the Court
during trial that he did not know what White's response
would be to the counseling question only to shift gears
moments later and state that he expected the testimony to be
favorable. As to RAB's claim that Radbil had “ambushed”
it with the $45,000 damages testimony, Radbil's circular,
threefold response, set forth in detail above, was simply
not believable in any sense, particularly once RAB was
able to point to portions of its records that contradicted
Radbil's response.242 Adding to the dubious nature of Radbil's
excuses at trial for offering the $45,000—and bordering on
the ridiculous—were the number of conflicting excuses that
followed throughout the later sanctions hearings. The excuses
from trial and the sanctions hearings included, but were not
limited to; that the $45,000 had been disclosed to RAB,
that the $45,000 was disclosed but not quantified, that the
$45,000 was not disclosed because it was mental anguish
damages, that it was not disclosed because it was privileged
and RAB never sought the privileged document, that it was
nothing but a “rogue” response by White never intended to
be offered, and, that it was never intended to be offered
because the $45,000 in damages was solely attributable to
Texas Guaranteed and not RAB. The fact that Radbil was
lying to the Court about the $45,000 was further substantiated
by his own client's comments, the day Radbil failed to appear
for trial, when he apologized to the Court that Radbil had
not been straightforward about the damages evidence. As
addressed multiple times above, this occurred during trial on
the morning that Radbil failed to appear.243
*28  Another example of Radbil's penchant for prevarication
was in his argument to the Court during trial that he needed
to recall RAB's Director of Compliance, Robert F. Wyatt, to
the witness stand to question Wyatt on a topic that he had,
according to Radbil, inadequately answered at his pretrial
deposition. In making his argument to the Court, Radbil
quoted from Wyatt's deposition. A key fact that Radbil
failed to disclose to the Court—but was later revealed by
RAB—was that the sufficiency of Wyatt's deposition, from
which Radbil quoted, had already been addressed during
pretrial discovery and remedied by the magistrate judge who
ordered a second deposition that corrected the problem. 244
Radbil's arguments and his quoting from the first deposition,
without mentioning the second, were blatantly misleading to
the Court. On top of that, once caught, Radbil refused to
acknowledge his misdeed to the Court either at trial or in the
post-trial sanctions hearings.245

During the sanctions hearings, Radbil's bad faith actions—in
tandem with Myers'—escalated. In question after question by
Malone, Radbil refused to concede the obvious, delaying the
proceedings and obfuscating the truth. For example, during
his testimony at the August 2, 2013 sanctions hearing, Radbil
refused to concede the simple truth that his Texas office
was actually just a post office box or that he had previously
been suspended from the practice of law for failing to pay
his dues.246 Similarly wanting, was his response to RAB's
counsel's question as to whether he had ever communicated
a reasonable settlement demand to RAB. So convoluted
and evasive was Radbil's answer, that the Court had to
intervene.247 And then, as mentioned, were his continually
evolving and conflicting excuses for the $45,000 in damages,
none of which were credible. He also switched his position
on the counseling issue from trial where he told the Court
he did not know whether White had sought counseling to the
sanctions hearing where he insisted that White had sought
counseling and had disclosed it to RAB. 248 On top of that,
there was absolutely no support at all for his claim either
that White had sought counseling or had ever disclosed such
efforts. Radbil simply lied to the Court about this, both at the
hearing and in his sanctions hearing briefing.
As discussed, Myers' entry into the case at the start of the
sanctions hearings, as Radbil's and the firm's representative,
only made matters worse, at times lending an almost ‘circus-
like’ atmosphere to the proceedings with Myers' ‘sleight-
of-hand’249 approach to the facts. First, and much to the
Court's surprise, in his opening statement, Meyers refused to
acknowledge that Radbil had done anything wrong during
trial—save showing up late for the second day of the
proceedings. Myers also oddly told the Court during his
opening that he had never even spoken to White about the
trial or the pending sanctions motions because he (Myers)
“didn't want to get a skewed vision of what happened.”
That Myers, the firm's representative, would not have even
spoken to the client about Radbil's handling of the client's
case when Radbil's handling of the case was the sole reason
for the sanctions motions was nonsensical. Myers' flimsy
justification for not talking to White was not credible. This is
particularly so given Myers' later production of the October
2, 2013 “Declaration” by White at the November 6, 2013
sanctions hearing. More specifically, even though Myers had
told the Court during his opening that he had purposely not
spoken to White in preparation for the sanctions hearing, he
not only later spoke to White, he had White sign a sworn
statement that was submitted by Myers as an exhibit at the
November 6, 2013 hearing. In this belated “Declaration” by
White, he disavowed that he had ever any intent to seek hard
damages from the jury, and parroted Meyers' and Radbil's
argument that Radbil and White had never planned to submit
such damage figures to the jury.
*29  As mentioned, the evidentiary value of White's belated
“Declaration” was questionable given White's absence from
the entirety of the sanctions proceedings and given that it
contradicted White's strong statements to the Court during
trial that he had intended to submit hard damages figures
to the jury. But what truly undermined the Declaration's
validity and called into question Myers' and Radbil's motives
in sponsoring the Declaration was the eventual disclosure
(during the last sanctions hearing) of the contents of White's
much earlier and highly contradictory December 6, 2012
pretrial memo to Radbil. As described above, Radbil had
the December 6, 2012 memo in his possession during all
of the proceedings and had alluded to it but refused to
disclose its contents, saying it was privileged and that RAB
had never established an exception to the privilege. All the
while, Radbil maintained that he and White had not planned
to seek hard damages from the jury. When it was finally
disclosed, over Radbil's counsel's objection, the December 6,
2012 memo corroborated what White told the Court during
trial that he and Radbil planned to seek hard damages from
the jury. Without White at the sanctions hearings to explain
the discrepancies between the two writings, the Court is left
to speculate as to whether the October 2, 2013 memo was
concocted by Myers and Radbil to support their defense to
the sanctions motions. One thing is certain and that is that the
fact that the two withheld the contents of the December 6,
2012 memo and prepared another memo for White's signature
that flatly contradicted the one in their possession smacks of
a fraud on the Court or, at the least, highly unprofessional
behavior that should not be countenanced in federal court.
Whether Radbil's and Myers' questionable behavior in this
case was an aberration or simply business as usual for
the firm, was clarified at the October 9, 2013 sanctions
hearing, which confirmed the latter. As addressed above,
through a series of documents from other court cases as
well information acquired from public web-sites controlled
by Myers, RAB was able to show that Radbil, Myers and
other members of the firm had been involved in multiple
run-ins with other courts and had fabricated information
about Radbil's accomplishments.250 One of the more notable
skirmishes was in the Scarlott case in the Southern District
of Texas, described above, in which the attorneys for

## Page 22

White v. Regional Adjustment Bureau, Inc., Not Reported in Fed. Supp. (2015)
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 22
Defendant Nissan filed a thirty-page motion for sanctions
accusing Radbil and his co-counsel of lying in their pleadings
in order to sustain an untenable case. 251 In granting the
motion for sanctions against Radbil and co-counsel and
awarding $195,000 to Nissan, the judge criticized Radbil
for his “abysmal judgment and performance” and described
the firm's actions in that case as “unconscionable” and
“unprincipled.”252 Another federal judge chastised Radbil
for “petty gamesmanship” while yet another accused him
of making “misrepresentations” regarding his eligibility to
practice law in that district.253
RAB was also able to show that Radbil and Myers (as the
sponsor of the public web-sites) fabricated information about
Radbil's experience and accomplishments on their public
web-sites. From claiming victories in cases that Radbil lost,
such as the Whaley case described above, to simply making up
stories about Radbil's purported clients, through public web-
sites, controlled by Meyers, Radbil and Myers shamelessly
lied to the public. 254 In one posting hailing Radbil as a
sort of pioneer in music downloading cases, the evidence
showed that Radbil was not even licensed to practice law
when that case went to trial.255 Same with a posting lauding
Radbil for his involvement in a major copyright infringement
case involving “Scribd,” which occurred before Radbil was
licensed as an attorney. 256 Another posting touts Radbil's
involvement in a case representing a group of NCAA athletes
when Radbil was never even listed as attorney of record. 257
Much more detail is set forth above and thus will not be
repeated. Suffice it to say, first, that none of this was refuted
by Radbil or Myers. And second, as set out above, clear and
convincing evidence reveals a pattern of conduct by Radbil
and Myers, with no ethical oversight, run amok. Sanctions for
bad faith conduct are most assuredly in order.
IV .
LEGAL STANDARDS
Sanctions—The Court's Inherent Authority
Federal courts have the inherent authority to manage their
own affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious
disposition of cases. Chambers v. NASCO, Inc. , 501 U.S.
32, 43-45 (1991)(citations omitted). Toward that end, federal
courts are empowered to sanction bad faith conduct occurring
during the litigation. Elliott v. Tilton, 64 F.3d 215, 216 (5th
Cir. 1995). It goes without saying that lying to the court 258
constitutes bad faith conduct. See generally, Chambers, 501
U.S. at 42, 46, 50-51  (upholding the district court's use of
its inherent authority to sanction bad faith conduct which
included “misleading and lying to the court.”). The court's
inherent authority is to be invoked, however, only when
“no sanction established by the Federal Rules or pertinent
statute is ‘up to the task,’ ” Chambers, 501 U.S. at 43-46 .
As explained by the Supreme Court in Chambers, certain
sanctioning mechanisms reach “only certain individuals or
conduct” but “the inherent power extends to a full range of
litigation abuses.” Id. at 46.
*30  Here, although RAB's motions for sanctions are
grounded in Fed. R. Civ. P. 37  and Title 28 U.S.C. § 1927 ,
which cover a certain range of the conduct alleged, neither are
up to the task of meting out the appropriate punishment for
the egregious conduct in this case. Specifically, recognizing
Radbil's undeniable misdeeds involving faulty pretrial
disclosures, late witness list supplementation, and the like,
it is his and Meyers' flagrant abuse of the judicial process
—their bad faith conduct—that is due the most scrutiny.
The scope of their conduct exceeds the conduct punishable
under Rule 37 and § 1927. To put a finer point on it, Radbil
and Meyers perpetrated a fraud on the Court and counsel
through a persistent pattern of misrepresentations, evasive
responses, and outright lies to the Court and counsel. To be
clear, the Court is not discounting Radbil's serial violations of
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or Meyers' and Radbil's
flouting of the rules of professional conduct. Instead, the
evidence of those violations, replete in fifty some odd pages
of this opinion, is considered in the aggregate by the Court
in concluding that Radbil and Meyers engaged in bad faith
conduct and, in so doing, abused the judicial process. Both
Meyers and Radbil were informed, more than once by the
Court, that their conduct was being scrutinized for bad faith
under the Court's inherent authority.259
Coextensive with the inherent authority to mete out sanctions
is the requirement that these implied powers be exercised
with restraint and discretion. Chambers, 501 U.S. at 44
(citing Roadway Express v. Piper, 447 U.S. 752, 764 (1980)).
Inherent powers “may be exercised only if essential to
preserve the authority of the court and the sanction must
employ” the least possible power adequate to the purpose
to be achieved. Natural Gas Pipeline of Am. v. Energy
Gathering Inc., 86 F. 3d 464, 467 (5th Cir. 1996) (citations
omitted). In other words, the sanction must “be tailored to
fit the particular wrong.” Topalian v. Ehrman, 3 F.3d 931,

936 n.5 (5th Cir. 1993) (extending the analytical principles
for determining sanctions under Rule 11 “across-the-board”
to all of the district court's sanctioning powers). The court's
inherent authority vests the court with discretion “to fashion
an appropriate sanction for conduct which abuses the judicial
process.” Chambers, 501 U.S. at 44-45 . Conduct which
abuses the judicial process includes, but is not limited to;
practicing a fraud upon the court as well as delaying or
disrupting litigation. Id. at 45-46 . Available sanctions under
the court's inherent authority include a number of options
ranging from an assessment of attorney's fees to disbarment.
Id.; In the Matter of Sealed Appellant, 194 F.3d 666, 671 (5th
Cir. 1999)(internal citations omitted).
Attorney's Fees
1. Trial Misconduct
RAB seeks to recover all of its attorney's fees and expenses for
its preparation and participation in the trial of this case. RAB
also seeks its attorney's fees and expenses for its preparation
for and appearance at all of the sanctions hearings. The Court
will address the trial fees first and then the fees incurred for
the sanctions proceedings. So far as its trial-related fees, RAB
seeks its costs and fees covering the time period from the
inception of the case, August, 2011 through the end of trial,
February 28, 2013.260
Appropriate factors to consider in determining the amount of
an award of attorney's fees sanction include: (1) the precise
conduct being punished; (2) the precise expenses caused by
the violation; (3) the reasonableness of the fees imposed; and
(4) the least severe sanction adequate to achieve the purpose
of the rule relied upon to impose the sanction. Topalian, 3 F.3d
at 936. Only those fees caused by the party's misconduct are
permissible. Smith & Fuller v. Cooper Tire & Rubber Co., 685
F.3d 486, 490 (5th Cir. 2012).
While it cannot be said that Radbil's unprofessional behavior
leading up to and continuing through the trial caused
all of RAB's trial attorney's fees, the Court finds that a
portion of those fees, beginning in December 2012 through
the end of trial in February 28, 2013, were incurred
as a direct result of Radbil's bad faith conduct. In so
finding, the Court incorporates, without repeating, its factual
findings, detailed above, regarding Radbil's trial conduct.
Just a few of the multitude of examples of this behavior
include when, immediately before trial, RAB's attorneys were
forced to research and file objections to Radbil's untimely
witness designations. Radbil never did provide an adequate
explanation for his untimely witness designations or his
inconsistent responses to RAB's objections to his witness
designations, leaving RAB in the dark as to Radbil's intended
witnesses until the pretrial conference. During trial, Radbil
improperly offered evidence on counseling and damages that
had never been disclosed to RAB before trial. This, in turn,
caught RAB by surprise, forcing it to object and spend time
researching its records and explaining to the Court precisely
why Radbil's actions were objectionable instead of focusing
on its trial strategy. The amount of time that RAB spent
going back through its own records to counter false statements
by Radbil is not adequately reflected in the trial transcript.
Nonetheless, the Court watched first-hand as RAB's attorneys
scrambled on several occasions to search their files to respond
to Radbil's misrepresentations during trial. And, of course,
persistent throughout the trial, were Radbil's evasive, circular
responses and outright misrepresentations to the Court which
disrupted and delayed the proceedings.261
*31  Having reiterated in general terms Radbil's offending
behavior at trial, the Court acknowledges that determining the
precise amount of RAB's attorney's fees—dollar-for-dollar
—that were directly caused by Radbil's bad faith conduct
at trial cannot be done with exactitude. In other words,
segregating the fees that RAB incurred as a direct result
of Radbil's misconduct from the fees that were otherwise
incurred by RAB in the course of trial does not lend itself to
numerical precision. But courts recognize that attorney fees
sanctions need not and sometimes cannot be calculated with
mathematical precision. Topalian v. Ehrman, 3 F.3d 931, 938
n. 7 (5th Cir. 1993) . The sanctioning court must, however,
provide “some avenue to trace [its] reasoning and review [its]
exercise of discretion.” Id.
Here, the Court's extensive involvement in the trial
proceedings and first-hand observation of Radbil's behavior
during the trial provides a substantial basis for quantifying
RAB's reasonable attorney's fees incurred due to Radbil's
behavior. While Radbil's unfortunate conduct permeated the
trial, it did not subsume all of the trial time. In this Court's
view, a conservative estimate by the Court of RAB's attorney's
fees that were caused by Radbil's conduct would be one-
third of the total attorney's fees incurred by RAB at trial.
The relevant time period for calculating these fees is between
December 2012 through February 28, 2013. To determine the
specific amount of fees due, additional records are needed
from RAB.262 This information should include all relevant
billing records for the time period from December 2012
through February 28, 2013, with a total figure of fees incurred

## Page 24

White v. Regional Adjustment Bureau, Inc., Not Reported in Fed. Supp. (2015)
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 24
for that time period divided by one-third. Having said that, the
Court notes that Malone testified credibly at the November 6,
2013 sanctions hearing about how she calculated RAB's fees
and costs incurred from the inception of the case through the
November 6th sanctions hearing. Her testimony covered and
satisfied all of the relevant “lodestar” considerations and such
information need not be resubmitted with these additional
records.263
*32  As mentioned, the Court's first-hand involvement in
the case made assessing the reasonableness of the fees
a much more straightforward task than that confronting
other courts deciding fee awards lacking this perspective.
Moreover, Malone's hourly rate was only $175. 264 This is
an extremely reasonable hourly rate for a lawyer of Malone's
experience.265 Malone's associates and paralegals 266 billed
at hourly rates of $140 and $80, respectively. 267 This award
is due and owing jointly and severally from Radbil and
Meyers. As set out in the factual findings, Meyers was
directly involved in this case before trial as a partner of the
Weisburg firm. Moreover, he dubiously defended Radbil's
trial conduct, seemingly perplexed by what he described as
“naked allegations” against Radbil. 268 The Court finds this
attorney's fee award to be the least severe sanction appropriate
to deter similar trial misconduct.
2. Sanctions Hearings
RAB also seeks its attorney's fees and costs in relation to
the sanctions motions and hearings that followed. This would
include all of its costs and fees incurred in preparing the
sanctions motions as well as those incurred in connection with
each of the sanctions hearings on August 2, 2013, August 7,
2013, October 9, 2013, November 6, 2013, and November
26, 2013. It is hardly a leap of logic to conclude that RAB's
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the sanctions
hearings were solely caused by Radbil's and Meyer's bad faith
conduct as detailed in the Court's factual findings. Under
appropriate circumstances, a sanction award may include the
entire amount of attorney's fees incurred as a result of the bad
faith conduct. Chambers, 501 U.S. at 55. Accordingly, RAB
is entitled to recover all of its reasonable attorney's fees and
expenses incurred in connection with preparing the sanctions
motions as well as for its preparation for and attendance at the
sanctions hearings.
Malone testified credibly at the November 6, 2013 sanctions
hearing regarding the amount of RAB's costs and expenses
incurred by her and her firm in connection with the sanctions
motions and hearings. For the same reasons discussed
above, Malone's testimony satisfied the lodestar factors. 269
Specifically, she established, inter alia, the reasonableness of
the fees and expenses RAB incurred, as well as her hourly
rate, the time, labor and skill required. The undesirability of
the case was clear from the record. Nonetheless, her testimony
and records covered RAB's expenses in connection with
the sanctions issues only up through her testimony at the
November 6, 2013 hearing. Given that the November 26,
2013 hearing had yet to occur, the evidence supporting RAB's
total sanction-related fees and expenses is incomplete. 270
Malone's credible testimony established that the total figure
for RAB's fees and expenses from the close of trial and
preparation of the sanctions motions through the November
6, 2013 hearing was $44,951.50.271 So, in order to adequately
and accurately compensate RAB for its total attorney's fees
and expenses incurred in connection with the sanctions issues,
RAB is directed to submit supplemental billing records (to
RAB-S Tab, 41) setting out its attorney's fees and expenses
incurred up through the conclusion of the November 26, 2013
sanctions hearing. Given the egregious conduct of both Radbil
and Meyers at the sanctions hearings, this fee award is due
and owing from both Radbil and Meyers and is also the least
sanction appropriate under the circumstances to compensate
RAB for its attorney's fees and expenses caused directly by
Radbil's and Meyers' conduct.
Suspension/Disbarment
*33  Finally, and most importantly, Radbil and Meyers must
be sanctioned for their egregious abuse of the judicial process.
Their systematic pattern of evasion, misrepresentation and
outright lies during the trial and the sanctions proceedings did
not just negatively impact RAB, it degraded the entire judicial
process. See Chambers, 501 U.S. at 42, 46  (misleading
and lying to the court degrades the judicial system). When
the integrity of the judicial process itself has been abused,
the court's authority to remedy the wrong derives from its
inherent power to police itself and to vindicate its judicial
authority. Id. at 45-46 . Toward that end, courts have the
right to “control admission to its bar and discipline attorneys
who appear before it.” Id. at 43 (internal citations omitted).
This includes the power to disbar an attorney for bad faith
conduct. Crowe v. Smith, 261 F.3d 558, 563 (5th Cir. 2001).272
“The power of disbarment is necessary to protect the public's
confidence in the profession and judicial system because
a court implicitly represents that an attorney permitted to

practice before it is in good standing to do so.” In re Sealed
Appellant, 194 F.3d at 674(internal citations omitted).
“Courts have long recognized an inherent authority to disbar
attorneys.” Id. at 671. A specific finding of bad faith by
the court is a prerequisite to disbarment. Id. The term “bad
faith” has been described as conduct involving “fraudulent
intent and a desire to suppress the truth.” Consolidated
Aluminum Corp. v. Alcoa, Inc., 244 F.R.D. 335, 344 (M.D. La.
2006). Misrepresentations to the court and other intentional
misconduct involving dishonesty, fraud, and deceit can be
grounds for disbarment. In re Sealed Appellant,  194 F.3d
at 674  (internal citation omitted); Crowe, 261 F.3d at 563 .
Because attorney disbarment is an extreme sanction, the
court's decision to disbar must be supported by clear and
convincing evidence of bad faith. Id.
With the foregoing standards in mind, the Court finds
that there is clear and convincing—if not overwhelming—
evidence that Radbil and Myers engaged in bad faith conduct
by lying to and otherwise misleading the Court and RAB's
counsel during the course of the proceedings. In so finding,
the Court relies upon its factual findings, in particular, its
summary of the factual findings for support.273 Some general
observations are also helpful. First, as evident in the 50-plus
pages of factual findings, Radbil's and Meyer's missteps were
by no means subtle. In other words, it does not require an
in-depth analysis to conclude that, on numerous occasions,
Radbil and Meyers were simply making things up. In fact,
many of their misrepresentations were startlingly obvious.
For example, Radbil's statement to the Court—when he asked
White during his trial testimony about counseling—that he
did not know what White's response would be and then,
a few minutes later, stating that he expected the testimony
to be favorable was just not logical. The same goes for
Radbil's numerous inconsistent statements about the $45,000
in damages testimony. With five or so internally inconsistent
explanations for the $45,000, one thing is certain: they cannot
all be true.
Myers fared no better. His opening statement at the August
2, 2013 sanctions hearing, in which he insisted to the Court
that he had not spoken to White because he did not want to
get a “skewed vision” of what happened during the trial made
no sense and called into question Meyers' fitness to practice
law. His later co-production of White's “Declaration” only
reinforced that he and Radbil were equal partners in their
abuse of the judicial process.274
*34  In sum, there is overwhelming evidence of bad faith
conduct by Radbil and Myers in this case. They must
therefore be called to account for their behavior. A simple
assessment of attorney's fees falls far short of what is
needed to deter Radbil's and Myers' bad faith conduct and
vindicate the judicial process. This, given the fact that both
attorneys and their former firm have had numerous ethical
run-ins with other courts in the past and, nevertheless,
conducted themselves as they did in this case. To prevent their
disreputable behavior from recurring, they must be precluded
from practicing in the Northern District of Texas for a defined
period of time. While disbarment is certainly an option, the
Court finds the lesser sanction of a three-year suspension is
adequate under the circumstances to accomplish the purpose
to sanctioning Radbil and Myers for their bad faith conduct
and to deter such conduct in the future. Accordingly both
Radbil and Myers are suspended from practicing law in
the Northern District of Texas for a period of three years
commencing on the date this Order is entered in this case.
After the three year period, Radbil and Myers may reapply
for admission but only on the condition that they have paid
the attorneys fees assessed against them and due and payable
to RAB.

51 The full account from this discussion between the Court and Radbil when the Court asks whether he had made the
$40,000 and $5000 damages disclosures reads:
MR. RADBIL: ... [describing when and how he disclosed the foregoing damages] ... And in our [Radbil's] supplemental
disclosures, our pretrial disclosures, we have amended that. I believe with respect to the charges that Mr. White
incurred, he incurred those after the deposition.
THE COURT: Where are the submissions that give them notice of the amount of damages that you are seeking outside
of the in initial response that Ms. Malone referred to? Where are they disclosed?
MR. RADBIL: In the pretrial order. They were disclosed at the mediated settlement conference.
THE COURT: Okay. Well, you know better than that. You know—the federal rules require you to respond to questions
about damages so that they can meet your proof at trial. So the fact that you discussed it in mediation doesn't count.
MR. RADBIL: Okay.
THE COURT: And you know that. And so the pretrial order—
MR. RADBIL: Pretrial disclosures.
THE COURT: The pretrial disclosures, okay. Show me where and what page and where those would be.
MR. RADBIL: I believe we copied and pasted from the pretrial order. I don't know if I have a copy of our pretrial
disclosures with me.
THE COURT: Ms. Malone, do you have those?
MS. MALONE: Yes, ma'am, I sure do.
THE COURT: Thank you.
Mr. Radbil, take a seat. Let me hear what she has to say.
MS. MALONE: Your Honor, just so you know, the first entry under tab 6 is his original disclosures. I apologize for the
highlighting. And the second one behind the yellow sheet is his supplemental.
THE COURT: And they are not in there?
MS. MALONE: They are.
THE COURT: As far as—
MS. MALONE: The references to the damages is not included in the supplemental.
THE COURT: Mr. Radbil?
MR. RADBIL: I don't know what document—

THE COURT: Okay. Let's have you take a look at it.
MR. RADBIL: Defendant's wrongful conduct caused the plaintiff to suffer legitimate actual damages. Plaintiff's actual
damages not only include out-of-pocket expenses but also damages for personal humiliation—
THE COURT: What exactly are you reading from?
MR. RADBIL: Defendant's APP018, document 76-1.
THE COURT: I guess my question is, where is it in there that talks about this amount of money above the $1,500 that
you initially disclosed. And I think it would be better if you went back to the microphone.
MR. RADBIL: It's not quantified.
THE COURT: So they weren't on notice of the amounts that you have come up with here during the testimony at trial.
MR. RADBIL: Through our settlement negotiations.
THE COURT: Okay.
MR. RADBIL: And—
THE COURT: ...
Go ahead. What else? Where else?
MR. RADBIL: Certainly not here.
THE COURT: So you agree that the amounts that were talked about were never specifically disclosed.
MR. RADBIL: I don't know the definitive answer, but I know that we have supplemented and they [RAB] have been on
notice of a significant amount of actual damage for a long time.
THE COURT: By virtue of what?
MR. RADBIL: I don't have all of our discovery responses.
THE COURT: You can't tell me off the top of your head where you might have disclosed the specific amount beyond
the $1,500?
MR. RADBIL: A specific amount? I don't know whether we did disclose a specific amount.
THE COURT: I've heard enough. Anything else?
MR. RADBIL: There's a requirement to disclose the exact amount of the damages that we're seeking?
THE COURT: What is your position on that?
MR. RADBIL: That the damages—
THE COURT: You have a federal practice, is that what you say?
MR. RADBIL: I'm sorry?
THE COURT: You have a federal practice, is that what you say?
MR. RADBIl: You have a federal practice, and you don't know the answer to the question ?

MR. RADBIL: He's seeking damages—
THE COURT: How about a straight answer?
MR. RADBIL:—for mental anguish and emotional distress.
THE COURT: How about a straight answer? You don't know the answer to that question?
MR. RADBIL: That is a straight answer to the question.
THE COURT: That you have no obligation to quantify your damages in federal practice when asked in discovery and
even by virtue of the disclosure requirement. You're saying that you don't know if that's a requirement. You don't know
that that's a requirement. That's what you have said. Am I right?
MR. RADBIL: That's a question for—the jury determines the actual amount of damages.
THE COURT: Mr. Radbil, I have never heard more prevarication in my life. Have a seat. Have a seat.

87 Because there are multiple instances of misconduct by Radbil complained of by RAB, (i.e. Radbil's failure to properly
prepare for trial, to timely file and serve his exhibit list on RAB; his failure to provide the Court with any exhibits, etc.), the
Court, for the most part, confines its discussion to the most serious violations.

92 The discussion on his suspension mirrored his circular method of avoiding a straight answer to a straightforward
questions:
Q. (By Malone): Mr. Radbil, during the course of this case on the second deposition that was taken of Bob Wyatt, at that
time you were technically suspended from the State Bar of Texas for failure to pay your bar dues; isn't that correct?
A. (Radbil): I don't know the answer to that. I don't recall the exact date when that occurred.... I know that you and I had a
case in the Dallas County District Court, and before court one morning I came in and was sitting next to you. And then we
made our appearances on the record, at which time you said there was a housekeeping matter, Judge. It's come to my
attention that Mr. Radbil has been—his law license has been suspended for not paying bar dues, at which point—and this
is all on the record. Of course I was surprised and shocked and told the judge that was news to me, that it was something
that my firm handles as a logistical matter for me. And you said that I couldn't appear in court. And we actually called the

State Bar on a conference call and found out that what I had to do was just to pay my dues immediately and that I could
do that online, and we took care of that online and proceeded. So there's a record of that, and I would defer the Court—
Q.(Court): You were suspended, she was right, correct?
A. (Radbil): I don't know whether ...
Q. (Court): Oh, come on, Mr. Radbil. You were suspended when she said you were suspended, you just agreed to it
by talking about what you did with the State Bar; you were suspended when she said you were suspended during that
case for not paying your dues, correct?
A. (Radbil): I don't know the answer to that. I think the fee issue is the eligible practice versus merit-based suspension.
Q. (Court): Were you suspended from the practice of law for not paying your dues?
A. (Radbil): I would have to contact the State Bar and find out the answer to that.
Q. (Court): So you don't know the answer.
A. (Radbil): Correct.

Q. (Malone): Isn't it also true that following the summary judgment motion only Mr. Meyers communicated with me
regarding settlements.
A. (Radbil): That's incorrect.
Q. (Malone): Are you saying that you communicated with me regarding settlements after the summary judgment ruling
by the Court?
A. (Radbil): Specifically, yes.
Q. (Malone): At mediation only.
A. (Radbil): No, prior to.
Q. (Malone): When did you communicate a demand to me, Mr. Radbil?
A. (Radbil): I remember—I have an e-mail in one of the binders that you and I are discussing settlement, particularly my
view that our clients would hopefully resolve this matter at the mediated settlement conference so we wouldn't have to
try Dr. White's remaining claims.
THE COURT: The question she [Malone] asked you was, when did you communicate a demand to her?
A. (Radbil): There was an initial demand before we filed suit, and then far before the mediated settlement conference
there was an $8,500 demand that was communicated to Ms. Malone.
THE COURT: By you?
A. (Radbil): Personally, no, it was not.

Q. (By Ms. Malone): My question is: When did you relay any demands to me prior to the mediated settlement conference,
Mr. Radbil?
A. (Radbil): Relay or personally—I didn't personally—
Q. (Malone): Personally give me one, Mr. Radbil.
A. (Radbil): I don't recall whether I did or not. I may have—
Q. (Malone):Thank you, sir.
A. (Radbil):—but we certainly—
Q. (Malone): Okay. Now, Mr. Radbil, at the mediated settlement conference, did you make a demand in excess of
$100,000?
A. (Radbil): Does the Court allow me to talk about the mediated settlement conference?
THE COURT: I want you to answer the question; yes.
A. (Radbil): After discussing with my client at length and based on the strategy that I had prepared in good faith to try to
settle this matter, I think that, yes, a demand over $100,000 was made, although I don't recall the specific amount.
Q. (Malone): Did Judge Stickney tell you that demand was inappropriate in a case with the kind of damages we had.
A. (Radbil): I don't recall. I don't think so....

154 Q. (by Malone): If you would look with me, sir, at Exhibit Number 15. This is a motion for new trial that was filed by Mr.
Radbil in a case in Tarrant County. Do you see that?
A. (Meyers): Yes.
Q: Would you turn with me to page 765, which would be the last paragraph or the last section in that motion.
A: I am here.
Q: Do you see here that Mr. Radbil is making a motion to the Court indicating that he believes that a counsel must exhaust
their peremptory strikes prior to the Court making rulings on motions for cause on jurors?
A: Could you repeat that, please?
Q: Sure. If you need to read it, please do so, sir. Do you see from this particular section that Mr. Radbil is making the
argument that counsel must exhaust their peremptory strikes prior to the Court ruling on motion to cause strikes on
particular jurors?
A: Okay. I have read that.
Q: Okay. And that's essentially what he's saying, is he not, Mr. Meyers?
A: I'm sorry, would you repeat the question one last time?
Q: Sure. Would you agree with me that he is arguing that the Court should have required the peremptory strikes to be
exhausted prior to making rulings on motions for cause.

A: I think the pleading says what it says, but I don't have a reason to disagree with what you are saying.
Q: Okay. And that's not the way the jury selection works, does it, Mr. Meyers?
A: I think the rules speak for themselves.
Q: I am asking you, sir, as a supervising attorney, is that the way jury selection is supposed to work?
...
THE COURT: Okay.
A. (By Meyers): I believe—and I could be wrong—that you strike for cause and then you do peremptory challenges.
Q. (By Ms. Malone): So as of September 2011, when Mr. Radbil filed this motion, he at least did not appear to understand
the process for jury selection, is that fair?
A: I can't say that.
Q. Did you read the transcript from the Brown trial, sir?
A: I've read parts of it, yes, and I may have fully read it on one occasion.
Q: Okay.
A: But it would have been a very long time ago.
Q: Okay. So as of 2011, Mr. Radbil filed a motion that would indicate he didn't understand the jury looks like that is the
argument being made. So the question is: Do you agree that this would be incorrect?
...
THE WITNESS: I'm a little confused by the questions back and forth, but I do agree and believe that you would strike for
cause and then exercise peremptory challenges, if that's what's being asked.
THE COURT: All right.
Q. (By Ms. Malone): Thank you.

156 RAB-S at Tabs 15–42, 44. Radbil and Meyers are entitled to due process before sanctions are awarded against them by
the Court. Due process, in turn, requires notice and a meaningful opportunity for them to be heard. Ingram v. Glast, Phillips
& Murray, 196 Fed.Appx. 232, 233 (5th Cir. 2006). Due process, however, does not necessarily require that those facing
sanctions be afforded an evidentiary hearing or even a hearing on arguments alone before being subject to sanctions.
Id. (citing Merriman v. Sec. Ins., 100 F.3d 1187, 1191-92 (5th Cir. 1996); see also Cook v. American S.S. Co., 134 F.3d
771, 774-75 (6th Cir. 1998)). Here, Radbil, Meyers and the Weisburg firm were afforded notice of the pending sanctions
motions, an opportunity to respond via briefing and exhibits, four full evidentiary hearings and the ability to offer evidence
in the form of exhibits and testimony at those hearings. Even so, some of the “other case misconduct” exhibits offered by
RAB were not, in this Court's view, sufficiently supported by the record or the testimony to constitute reliable, probative
evidence for the Court's consideration. Though the Federal Rules of Evidence do not necessarily apply to sanctions
proceedings, the Court will not credit tenuously supported proof with probative value. Thus, unless a particular exhibit is
cited by the Court as being considered, RAB's exhibits and testimony relating to other case misconduct is disregarded.

obligation to do so as the firm's managing partner, he did not verify the accuracy of these entries before they were posted,
none of these claims were supported by any evidence at the hearing. Meyers also professed ignorance as to the veracity
of several questionable postings, one lauding Radbil's representation of a “major league” baseball player in a seven figure

261 For a sampling, see notes 51, 92, and 95, supra.
262 Although RAB presented testimony from Malone and exhibits at the sanctions hearings supporting its attorney's fee
request, the Court finds that additional information is needed for clarity. Specifically, Ms. Malone testified about attorney's
fees incurred at trial but the records she relied upon were documents submitted in connection with RAB's Rule 68 motion
(doc. 118), STR-4 at 112-55. The records attached to the Rule 68 motion (doc. 118) contain listings of fees and expenses
from the inception of the case in August 2011 through the end of the trial. See Doc. 118, Def. App. 155-315. Those records
also include affidavits by RAB's attorneys and paralegals as well as other documents supporting the reasonableness of
RAB's fee requests. Id., Def. App. 316-50. But the fees that are being awarded in this case for Radbil's misconduct cover
a more limited time period. Specifically, it is Radbil's misconduct, during and immediately prior to trial, for which fees are
being awarded. As stated above, the precise figure allowable would be one third of the attorney's fees incurred as a result
of Radbil's conduct between December 2012 and the end of trial, February 28, 2013. Costs in amount of $9,438.73 in
the case have already been ordered by separate order and cannot be included in this total.
263 STR-4 at135-56; A “strong presumption” of reasonableness attaches to attorney's fees calculated under the lodestar
method. Smith & Fuller, 685 F.3d at 490 (citing Heidtman v. County of El Paso, 171 F.3d 1038, 1044 (5th Cir. 1999)).
Those factors include: (1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the case; (3) the skill required; (4)
the preclusion of other employment; (5) the customary fee; (6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent; (7) time limitations
imposed; (8) the results obtained; (9) the experience, reputation and ability of the attorneys; (10) the undesirability of the
case; (11) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client; and (12) awards in similar cases. Johnson
v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714, 717-19 (5th Cir. 1974).
264 Malone testified that as of November 2013, her hourly rate increased to $200. STR-4 at 138.
265 In other cases involving Texas lawyers, the hourly rates range from $220 for associates to $510 for senior partners. E.g.,
Champion v. ADT Sec. Servs., Inc., No. 2:08-CV-417-TJW, 2010 WL 4736908, at * 8-9 (E.D. Tex. Nov. 16, 2010)(finding
that $350 for partner-level work is reasonable given that the hourly rates for partners in the Eastern District of Texas range
from $250 per hour to $450 per hour “for certain premium work”); Randolph v. Dimension Films, 634 F. Supp. 2d 779,
797-98 (S.D. Tex. 2009)(finding that rates of $510 per hour for a partner specializing in intellectual property law and $220
to $300 per hour for associates are reasonable); cf., e.g., Ranger Steel Servs., LP v. Orleans Materials & Equipment, No.
10-112, 2010 WL 3488236, at *1 (E.D. La. Aug. 27, 2010)(finding that hourly rates of $395 for partners are reasonable);
Hornbeck Offshore Servs., L.L.C. v. Salazar, No. 10-1663, 2011 WL 2214765, at *2 (E.D. La. June 1, 2011)(finding hourly
rates of $295 to $420 for partners and $180 to $195 for associates “are at the high end of rates,” but finding an hourly
rate of $450 reasonable for a partner with specialized qualifications).
266 See Greer v. Richardson Indep. Sch. Dist., 471 Fed.Appx. 336, 340 (5th Cir. 2012) (approving an award of attorney's
fees and paralegal fees as a sanction).

ORDER ADOPTING SPECIAL MASTER'S REPORT
AND RECOMMENDATION
JANE J. BOYLE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
*1  On June 28, 2017, the Court appointed, pursuant to
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 53 , retired United States
Magistrate Judge Jeff Kaplan as the Special Master in this
case. Doc. 281, Order Appointing Special Master. On July
3, 2018, Judge Kaplan issued a report and recommendation
on the parties' motions to exclude the testimony of certain
expert witnesses. Doc. 521, Notice of R&R.
Having reviewed Judge Kaplan’s Report and
Recommendation, the parties' objections to the report, and
responses to those objections, the Court ADOPTS Judge
Kaplan’s report except as follows.
First, the plaintiffs moved to exclude Lawrence Ranallo’s
testimony. They argued that the Court should exclude
Ranallo’s testimony in part because Ranallo did not disclose
that Price Waterhouse Coopers (PWC) employees helped him
to prepare his expert report. But the plaintiffs did not make
this argument until their reply in support of their motion to
exclude. Because the plaintiffs raised the argument only in
their reply, Judge Kaplan declined to rule on it. Now, the
plaintiffs say they raised the argument as soon as they could,
and they contend that Judge Kaplan should have considered
their argument or that the argument is properly before the
Court anyways. The Court declines at this time to decide
whether to exclude Ranallo’s testimony based on his alleged
failure to disclose PWC’s work on his expert report but will
rule on the admissibility of Ranallo’s testimony at the pretrial
conference. The Court directs the defendants to supplement
their response to the plaintiffs' objection to Judge Kaplan’s
report and recommendation with briefing responding to the
plaintiffs' argument that the Court should exclude Ranallo’s
testimony because of his failure to disclose the work that
PWC performed on his report. The defendants should file
this briefing by 5:00pm on Wednesday, July 25.
Second, the defendants moved to exclude the testimony of
Lori Jones, Herjit Pannu, and Robert Newman. Judge Kaplan
recommended that the Court deny the defendants' motion
but ordered the plaintiffs to supplement their disclosures of
these experts' opinions and allowed the defendants to depose
Lori Jones again. Even after the supplemental disclosures
and deposition, the defendants maintain that the Court should
prevent Jones, Pannu, and Newman from offering expert
opinions at trial. The Court continues to consider the briefing
on this argument, and though the Court declines to adopt
Judge Kaplan’s report and recommendation on Jones, Pannu,
and Newman at this time, the Court will decide whether to
exclude these witnesses' testimony at the pretrial conference.
Aside from those two exceptions: the court adopts in full
Judge Kaplan’s report and recommendation. The Court denies
the motions to exclude the testimony of:

ORDER
JANE J. BOYLE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
*1  Before the Court is Defendants TH Wealth Management,
LLC and Brian Keat Hobbs’ Motion for Continuance (Doc.
25). Defendants seek to continue the trial, which is currently
set for October 2, 2023, until February or March 2024. Doc.
25, Mot., 2–3. Although the Court may extend a deadline
upon a showing of good cause, Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b)(1) ,
Defendants have failed to show good cause for an extension
here. Accordingly, the Motion for Continuance (Doc. 25) is
DENIED.
This case was originally set for trial before the Honorable Sam
R. Cummings on September 6, 2022. Doc. 11, Scheduling
Order. Judge Cummings then vacated the trial setting on July
25, 2022. Doc. 14, Order. In February 2023, Judge Cummings
reset the trial for October 2, 2023. Doc. 18, Order. In June
2023, the case was reassigned to this Court. Doc. 20, Special
Order. The Court then ordered the parties to provide “an
update as to the current status of this case” as well as “a
proposed litigation timeline or updated scheduling order, if
required.” Doc. 21, Status Report Order.
The parties responded with a Joint Status Report. Doc.
22, Joint Status Report. In the report, Defendants’
counsel discussed potential conflicts but also unequivocally
confirmed that “the Parties [were] ready to proceed with the
jury trial in this case ... on October 2, 2023.” Id. at 1. Relying
on that assertion, the Court issued an Amended Scheduling
Order (Doc. 23). Defendants now move to continue the trial.
Doc. 25, Mot. Defendants first highlight that their counsel has
another trial that conflicts with the trial setting in this case.
Id. at 2. Defendants also indicate they need additional time
to designate an expert following a recent deposition. See id.
Neither reason provides good cause to continue the trial date.
As to the scheduling conflict, this case was first filed on
December 18, 2020. Doc. 1, Compl. Trial was initially set
for almost one year ago. See Doc. 11, Scheduling Order. And
while the continuance was not the fault of the parties, the
current October trial date has now been set for five months.
See Doc. 18, Order (resetting trial date on February 13, 2023).
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) also
contends that, per a conversation with the court coordinator of
the conflicting state case, the state case was set for trial three
months ago (i.e., two months after this case). Doc. 28, Searles
Decl., ¶ 3. Finally, the state case is a one-day trial that the state
court is amenable to moving. Id. In short, therefore, trial in
this case is long overdue, this trial was set first, and the one-
day trial in the state court can be moved.
As to Defendants’ contention that they need more time
for expert disclosures, their arguments are unconvincing.
Most importantly, Defendants have not explained the subject
matter of any expert testimony they are considering or
how the recent deposition implicates such expert testimony.
See id.  ¶ 4; see also  Doc. 25, Mot. Similarly, under the
original scheduling order, Defendants were required to make
expert disclosures by early June 2022. See Fed. R. Civ. P.
26(a)(2)(D) (providing that expert disclosures are due 90
days before trial); see also Doc. 11, Scheduling Order. But
Defendants made no disclosures then. Doc. 28, Searles Decl.,
¶ 6. Nor have they made any expert disclosures in this
case by the now-passed deadline. See id.  The lack of any
expert disclosures—then or now—undermines Defendants’
contention that more time is suddenly needed for expert
disclosures in this case.

*2  In sum, Defendants’ arguments regarding scheduling
conflicts and expert disclosures do not provide good cause
to continue this trial. The Motion for Continuance (Doc. 25)
is therefore DENIED.
SO ORDERED.

MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
JANE J. BOYLE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
*1  Before the Court is Plaintiff Certain Underwriters
at Lloyd's of London, Syndicate Nos. 2003, 1414, 0510,
4472, 1183, 1200, and 4444, Subscribing to Policy Number
NJL440003612's (Plaintiff or Underwriters) Amended
Motion for Summary Judgment. Doc. 46. For the reasons
explained below, Plaintiff's Motion is GRANTED.
I.
BACKGROUND
A. Factual History1
This is an insurance coverage dispute involving hail damage
to a hotel. Defendants Lowen Valley View, LLC and Panade
II Ltd. d/b/a Hilton Garden Inn (collectively Defendants) own
and operate the Hilton Garden Inn in Irving, Texas. Doc.
34, Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. 4 [hereinafter Defs.'
Resp.]. Underwriters issued a standard commercial property
insurance policy (the Policy) to Defendants covering the hotel
for the period from June 2, 2012, to June 2, 2013. Doc. 47,
Pl.'s Br. in Supp. of Am. Mot. Summ. J. 2 [hereinafter Pl.'s
Br.]. The Policy, by its terms, covered “direct physical loss or
damage to Covered Property at the premises described in the
Declarations caused by or resulting from any Covered Cause
of Loss.” Id. (referencing Doc. 48, Pl.'s App. in Supp. of Am.
Mot. Summ. J. [hereinafter Pl.'s App.] 133, Ex. D, Building
and Personal Property Coverage Form). The parties do not
dispute that hail was a covered cause of loss under the Policy.
See Doc. 11, Defs.' Answer & Countercls. ¶ 26; see also Doc.
47, Pl.'s Br. 11.
In November 2014, Ajay Desai, the vice president of the
company that manages the hotel, was evaluating the property
for potential capital improvement projects. Doc. 34, Defs.'
Resp. 5. Noticing that “the shingles on the top of the hotel
looked bad,” Desai contacted a roofing contractor, who
inspected the property and found evidence of significant
hail damage to the various roofing systems at the property.
Id. On December 22, 2014, this roofing contractor obtained
a weather history report from a company called Weather
Fusion/Point Data, which noted several hail events at or near
the hotel between the dates of January 1, 2006, and December
21, 2014. Id. (citing Doc. 48, Pl.'s App. 209–11, Ex. G,
Weather Fusion/PointData Report).2
Specifically, the report, dated December 22, 2014, noted nine
events of hail “at location” between January 1, 2006, and
December 21, 2014, five of which had “estimated maximum
hail size” of greater than one inch. See Doc. 48, Pl.'s App.
209–11, Ex. G, Weather Fusion/Point Data Report. Of the
nine hail events noted “at location,” seven occurred before the
policy period, one after, and one during, on June 13, 2012.
See id. The event with the largest “estimated maximum hail
size” noted “at location” was on May 24, 2011. See id. And
of the five events with “estimated maximum hail size” greater
than one inch, only the June 13, 2012 event occurred during
the policy period; the other four occurred prior to the policy
period. See id.
*2  Defendants' roofing contractor provided a copy of
the Weather Fusion/PointData report to Desai, who in
turn provided a copy to Defendants' insurance agent on
December 29, 2014. Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp. 5; Doc. 47, Pl.'s
Br. 3. Defendants' insurance agent filed a hail claim with

## Page 2

Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London v. Lowen Valley..., Not Reported in Fed....
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 2
Underwriters on behalf of Defendants on the same day. Doc.
34, Defs.' Resp. 5; Doc. 47, Pl.'s Br. 3. The description of the
damage provided to Underwriters was “roof damage due to
hail,” and the date of loss listed on the Property Loss Notice
was June 13, 2012, the date of the only hail event noted on the
Weather Fusion/PointData report provided to the insurance
agent that occurred during the policy period. Doc. 48, Pl.'s
App. 204–05, Ex. E, Property Loss Notice.
After receiving notice of the claim from the agent,
Underwriters assigned the investigation of the claim to
Frontier Adjusters, which sent an independent adjuster, Derek
Phipps, to inspect the property for hail damage in mid-January
2015. Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp. 5; Doc. 47, Pl.'s Br. 4; Doc. 48,
Pl.'s App. 231–38, Ex. J, Phipps Damage Estimate. 3 When
assigned the job, Phipps received only the Property Loss
Notice, which included no information about the Policy or
its coverage and no special instructions for the inspection.
Doc. 48, Pl.'s App. 205, Ex. E, Property Loss Notice; Doc.
33, Defs.' App. in Supp. of Resp. to Pl.'s Am. Mot. Summ. J.
[hereinafter Defs.' App.] 52–55, Ex. D, Dep. of Derek Phipps.
Before physically inspecting the property, Phipps consulted
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
reports online, which he used to confirm that a hail storm had
in fact occurred in the area and on the date of loss provided
to him by Frontier Adjusters. Doc. 33, Defs.' App. 65–66,
Ex. D, Dep. of Derek Phipps. Phipps's computer log notes
from January 16, 2015, indicate that he found significant hail
damage to the roofs and exterior siding upon inspection of
the property. Id. at 412, Ex. K, Phipps Computer Log Notes.
Phipps determined that the roofs would require replacement
rather than repair, and on January 19, 2015, prepared an
estimate of what it would cost to replace the roofs. Doc. 48,
Pl.'s App. 231–38, Ex. J, Phipps Damage Estimate. 4 Phipps
submitted his estimate to Frontier Adjusters through a web-
based computer program. Doc. 33, Defs.' App. 73, Ex. D,
Dep. of Derek Phipps.
*3  On March 2, 2015, Underwriters—through an authorized
claims administrator, Peninsula Insurance Bureau—sent a
“reservation of rights” letter to Defendants, which indicated
that the initial investigation had revealed “potential coverage
issues,” namely “late reporting of the loss.” Id. at 239–42, Ex.
K, Reservation of Rights Letter. Therefore, the letter stated,
the investigation would proceed “under a full reservation of
rights.” Id. It also directed Defendants to the specific policy
language requiring “prompt notice of the loss or damage.”
Id. (quoting Doc. 48, Pl.'s App. 35, Building and Personal
Property Coverage Form, Part E.3.a.2). Finally, the letter
noted that “any recommendations made by the adjuster [were]
subject to the Underwriters' review and approval.” Id. at 242.
Subsequently, Underwriters—through Frontier Adjusters—
engaged a company called Haag Engineering to “determine
the extent of hailstone impact damage to the roofing and
siding” and to “evaluate when hail damage might have
occurred.” Doc. 33, Defs.' App. 243, Ex. G, Haag Report No.
1. Haag's first report, dated April 8, 2015, noted that “[a] date
of June 13, 2012 was provided with our assignment.”  Id. at
244. After inspecting the property on March 17, 2015, and
consulting weather history reports from the National Climatic
Data Center, CoreLogic (formerly Weather Fusion, the same
company that provided the initial weather history reports to
Defendants' roofing contractor), and NOAA, Haag concluded
that “the most recent hailstorm with hailstones large enough
to cause the damage we observed was on June 13, 2012.” Id. at
250 (emphasis added). Notably, the CoreLogic report attached
to Haag's report contained the same history of hail events
found in the Weather Fusion/PointData report provided to
Desai and Defendants' insurance agent prior to the filing of the
claim. Compare Doc. 48, Pl.'s App. 209–11, Ex. G, Weather
Fusion/PointData Report (provided to Desai and insurance
agent), with Doc. 33, Defs.' App. 263–64, Ex. G, Haag Report
No. 1 (CoreLogic report attached to Haag Report No. 1).
A second report from Haag Engineering, ordered specifically
to “discuss the likelihood that damage occurred between
December 29, 2012 and December 29, 2014,” again noted
that Haag had “no reason to believe the dents occurred more
recently than the June 13, 2012 date given.” Id. at 363–64, Ex.
H, Haag Report No. 2 (emphasis added). This report also for
the first time identified “June 13, 2012 as the most likely date
damage occurred.” Id. at 363 (emphasis added). As discussed
below, Defendants place much weight on this slight change
in wording.
In December 2015, Underwriters requested an Examination
Under Oath of Ajay Desai, vice president of the hotel's
property management company. Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp. 8.
The Examination took place in January 2016. There, Desai
described how he first noticed the condition of the roofs
in November 2014 and how he sent the Weather Fusion/
PointData report to the insurance agent, who Desai suspected
then chose the date of loss to report to the insurer. See
generally Doc. 33, Defs.' App. Ex. C, Exam. Under Oath of
Ajay Desai; see also Doc. 48, Pl.'s App. 208, Ex. F, Exam.
Under Oath of Ajay Desai (“I think they looked at the history

and they probably saw which period had the highest amount
of hail and—I assume that's how they determined where to
file the claim.”).
A month later, on February 18, 2016, Underwriters denied
Defendants' claim “based on [Defendants'] failure to give
timely notice.” Doc. 48, Pl.'s App. 246–49, Ex. M, Denial
Letter. The Denial Letter again directed Defendants to
the “prompt notice” requirement in the Policy and stated
that Defendants “failed to give notice of the damage to
the Property until over two and a half years after the
alleged hailstorm.” Id. at 248. The Letter indicated that this
“late notice has prejudiced Underwriters' ability to properly
investigate the claim and pay only for damage that occurred
during the policy period.” Id. at 249.
B. Procedural History
*4  On the same day, February 18, 2016, Underwriters also
filed its Original Complaint and Request for Declaratory
Judgment, asking the Court to declare “that there is no
coverage under [the Policy] for the reported hail damage
because Defendants violated the policy's notice condition and
Underwriters suffered prejudice as a result.” Doc. 1, Pl.'s
Original Compl. & Req. for Declaratory J. ¶ 21. Defendants
later counterclaimed for declaratory judgment, breach of the
insurance contract, and multiple violations of §§ 541 and
542 of the Texas Insurance Code. Doc. 11, Defs.' Answer &
Countercls.5
Underwriters now moves for summary judgment on
Defendants' breach of contract and Texas Insurance Code
counterclaims. Doc. 46, Pl.'s Am. Mot. Summ. J [hereinafter
Pl.'s Mot.].6 Defendants responded (Doc. 32), and Plaintiff
replied (Doc. 43).7 Therefore, Plaintiff's Motion is now ripe
for review.
II.
LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment is appropriate “if the movant shows that
there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the
movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ.
P. 56(a). A dispute “is ‘genuine’ if the evidence is sufficient
for a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the non-moving
party.” Burrell v. Dr. Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Grp. , 482
F.3d 408, 411 (5th Cir. 2007). And a fact “is ‘material’ if its
resolution could affect the outcome of the action.” Id.
*5  The summary judgment movant bears the burden
of proving that no genuine issue of material fact exists.
Latimer v. Smithkline & French Labs. , 919 F.2d 301,
303 (5th Cir. 1990) . Usually, this requires the movant to
identify “those portions of the pleadings, depositions, answers
to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with
affidavits, if any, which it believes demonstrate the absence
of a genuine issue of material fact.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,
477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted).
But if the non-movant ultimately bears the burden of proof at
trial, the movant may satisfy its burden just by pointing to the
absence of evidence supporting the non-movant's case. Id. at
322–23.
If the movant meets that burden, then it falls to the non-
movant to “show with significant probative evidence that
there exists a genuine issue of material fact.” Hamilton v.
Segue Software Inc. , 232 F.3d 473, 477 (5th Cir. 2000)
(internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Conkling v. Turner,
18 F.3d 1285, 1295 (5th Cir. 1994)). And significant probative
evidence is just that: significant. See Little v. Liquid Air
Corp., 37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir. 1994)  (per curiam).
“[M]etaphysical doubt as to material facts,” “conclusory
allegations,” “unsubstantiated assertions,” or a mere “scintilla
of evidence” will not do. Id.(internal citations and quotation
marks omitted). Rather, “the non-movant must go beyond the
pleadings and present specific facts indicating a genuine issue
for trial.” Bluebonnet Hotel Ventures, L.L.C. v. Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A., 754 F.3d 272, 276 (5th Cir. 2014) (citing Celotex,
477 U.S. at 324).
To be sure, the court views evidence in the light most
favorable to the non-movant when determining whether a
genuine issue exists. Munoz v. Orr, 200 F.3d 291, 302 (5th
Cir. 2000). But it need not “sift through the record in search
of evidence to support a party's opposition to summary
judgment.” Ragas v. Tenn. Gas Pipeline Co. , 136 F.3d 455,
458 (5th Cir. 1998) (quoting Skotak v. Tenneco Resins, Inc.,
953 F.2d 909, 915–16 & n.7 (5th Cir. 1992)). Simply put, the
non-movant must “identify specific evidence in the record”
and “articulate the precise manner in which that evidence
supports [its] claim.” Id. If it cannot, then the court must grant
summary judgment. Little, 37 F.3d at 1076.

III.
ANALYSIS
A. Defendants' Evidentiary Objections
Before turning to the merits of Plaintiff's Motion,
the Court must first address Defendants' objections to
Plaintiff's summary judgment evidence. Defendants object to
paragraphs 10, 11, 12, 13, and 16 of the affidavit of Derek
Phipps, which is attached as Exhibit H to Plaintiff's Amended
Motion for Summary Judgment. Doc. 35, Defs.' Objs. to Pl.'s
Evid. in Supp. of Summ. J. [hereinafter Defs.' Objs.].
As noted above, Phipps was the independent adjuster
sent by Frontier Adjusters—on behalf of Underwriters—to
investigate the property a few weeks after the hail claim was
filed. Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp. 5; Doc. 47, Pl.'s Br. 4. Plaintiff
provided an affidavit from Phipps as part of its summary
judgment evidence. See Doc. 48, Pl.'s App. 212–15, Ex. H,
Aff. of Derek Phipps. The affidavit is dated July 25, 2016
—roughly five months after the claim was denied and this
lawsuit was filed—and it describes generally how Phipps's
investigation was affected by the two and a half year gap
between the time of the reported loss in June 2012 and the
filing and investigation of the claim in December 2014 and
January 2015. Id.
The entirety of the challenged portion of Phipps's affidavit
states the following:
10. “The late notice of the claim impacted the investigation
in the following ways:
*6  a. I was unable to inspect the insured property
immediately after the loss.
b. I was unable to document the condition of the roof
immediately following the Loss.
c. I was unable to determine if the roof or exterior
elevations had been impacted by other weather events or
other non-covered perils preceding the Loss.
d. I lost the opportunity to quantify the damage present
at the insured premises immediately after the Loss.
e. I lost the opportunity to interview witnesses who
may have known the prior condition of the roof and the
impact of the Loss.
f. The condition of the roofs changed significantly
between the time of the alleged hail storm and the
date notice was finally given, making investigation of
the existence and extent of the related damage nearly
impossible.”
11. “As a result of the late notice of the claim, the
investigation was severely hindered.”
12. “As a result of the late notice of the claim, I could not
conduct a full and fair investigation of the circumstances
surrounding the Loss in order to determine whether the
damage resulted from a covered peril.”
13. “Based on the Xactimate pricing, the late notice of the
claim increased the estimated cost to repair the damage to
the Property.”
....
16. “Based on the Xactimate pricing, the estimated cost
to repair the damage to the Property increased during the
thirty-month delay in the reporting of the claim. The cost
to repair the damage to the Property would have been
$47,802.67 less if the claim was reported immediately
following the Loss.”
Id. ¶¶ 10–13, 16.
Defendants' objections to these paragraphs fall into two
categories. First, Defendants object to paragraphs 10, 11, and
12 because, Defendants argue, the statements are conclusory,
fall within the realm of expert testimony, and conflict with
Phipps's (later) deposition testimony. Doc. 35, Defs.' Objs.
2–5. Second, Defendants object to paragraphs 13 and 16
because, according to Defendants, “they mischaracterize facts
in evidence.” Id. at 5.
A lay witness's testimony is limited to that which is within his
“personal knowledge of the matter,” as required by Federal
Rule of Evidence 602. Fed. R. Evid. 602. Lay witness opinion
testimony is “limited to those opinions or inferences which
are (a) rationally based on the perception of the witness, (b)
helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' [sic] testimony
or the determination of a fact in issue, and (c) not based on
scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within
the scope of Rule 702.” United States v. Cooks, 589 F.3d 173,
179–80 (5th Cir. 2009)  (citing Fed. R. Evid. 701 ). “[T]he
distinction between lay and expert witness testimony is that
expert testimony results from a process of reasoning which
can be mastered only by specialists in the field.” United

## Page 5

 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 5
States v. Yanez Sosa , 513 F.3d 194, 200 (5th Cir. 2008) .
Lay testimony, on the other hand, “must be the product
of reasoning processes familiar to the average person in
everyday life.” Cooks, 589 F.3d at 180 (citing United States
v. Garcia, 413 F.3d 201, 215 (2d Cir. 2005)).
Looking first at the statements in paragraphs 10, 11, and
12, the Court disagrees with Defendants that the statements
are conclusory or within the realm of expert testimony.
With the exception of paragraph 10(f), the Court finds that
the statements are merely facts within Phipps's personal
knowledge or opinions rationally based upon his perception
of the facts. For example, it is a temporal fact that Phipps “was
unable to document the condition of the roof immediately
following the loss,” which necessarily impacted his ability to
investigate the “circumstances surrounding the Loss.” Doc.
48, Pl.'s App. 214, Ex. H., Aff. of Derek Phipps ¶¶ 10, 11, 12.
*7  Turning to paragraph 10(f), however, the Court agrees
with Defendants. Paragraph 10(f) states that the “condition
of the roofs changed significantly between the time of the
alleged hail storm and the date notice was finally given.” Id.
¶ 10(f). But the rest of Phipps's affidavit belies his personal
knowledge of the condition of the roofs at the time of the
June 2012 hail storm. Because Phipps was unable to inspect
the roofs immediately following the June 2012 storm, and
because he is not designated as a roofing expert in this
case, he cannot definitively state that these roofs “changed
significantly” during the time between the storm and his
inspection. Therefore, Defendants' objection is SUSTAINED
on this point and paragraph 10(f) is STRICKEN from the
record.
As for Defendants' argument that the remainder of paragraphs
10, 11, and 12 conflicts with Phipps's deposition testimony,
the Court is not convinced. The Court disagrees with
Defendants that Phipps's affidavit conflicts with his later-
given deposition testimony. Defendants argue that Phipps's
affidavit stating that his investigation was impaired by the
two-and-a-half-year lapse in time between the claimed date
of loss and the filing and investigation of the insurance claim
conflicts with his later-given deposition testimony that he was
able to provide a complete estimate of the cost to replace the
roofs in January 2015. Doc. 35, Defs.' Objs. 3–5.
Phipps's ability to provide an estimate of what it would cost to
repair the damage he observed does not speak to whether this
investigation was hampered in any way. See Hamilton Props.
v. Am. Ins. Co. , No. 3:12-CV-5046-B, 2014 WL 3055801,
at *10 (N.D. Tex. July 7, 2014)  (noting that “the ability to
conduct the investigation does not necessarily speak to the
investigation's quality”), aff'd, 643 Fed.Appx. 437 (5th Cir.
2016). Furthermore, the Court finds that Phipps's September
2016 deposition testimony is, in fact, quite consistent with his
previous affidavit. See, e.g., Doc. 33, Defs. App. 121–22, Ex.
D, Dep. of Derek Phipps (“Q: Would it be fair to say that the
more time passes after a hail event damages a property, the
harder it is to tell when that damage occurred? A: That's fair
to say. Q: Would it be fair to say that, if there are multiple
hail events that caused damage to the property, the more time
passes, the harder it would get to determine which damage
was incurred on which date? A: I would agree with that.”).
Turning to Defendants' objections to paragraphs 13 and 16,
the Court disagrees that these paragraphs mischaracterize any
facts in evidence. Defendants' objection centers on Phipps's
use of the Xactimate computer program to compare the cost
to replace the roofs in June 2012 versus the cost to replace
them two and a half years later in January 2015. According
to Plaintiff, Xactimate is a commonly used comprehensive
software solution allowing insurance companies to estimate
materials and labor prices for a specific time and place based
on a constantly updated database of prices. Doc. 47, Pl.'s
Br. 17; see also Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp. 10–11 (acknowledging
that “Xactimate is typically used in the insurance industry
to prepare estimates and provide the estimator with unit
costs from a particular area of the state or country and for a
particular time”).
Phipps used Xactimate to prepare an estimate following
his inspection in January 2015—using January 2015 pricing
—which came to $472,028.08. Doc. 48, Pl.'s App. 214,
Ex. H, Aff. of Derek Phipps ¶¶ 8–9. Phipps later ran the
numbers again using June 2012 pricing, which produced an
estimate of $424,225.41. Id. ¶ 15–16. So according to Phipps's
calculations, if Defendants had reported the damage in June
2012 immediately after the storm that allegedly caused it
instead of waiting until December 2014, then—assuming the
loss was covered—the cost to repair the damage in June 2012
would have been $47,802.67 less based on materials and labor
costs at that time. Id. ¶ 16. Thus, according to Phipps, “[b]ased
on the Xactimate pricing, the late notice of the claim increased
the estimated cost to repair the damage to the Property.” Id.
¶ 13.
*8  Defendants contend that “[t]he fact that the estimate
prepared using the January 2015 pricing was higher than
the estimate prepared using the June 2012 pricing does not

prove that the late notice of claim increased the estimated
cost to repair the damage to the Property, but rather proves
that Phipps could have utilized June 2012 pricing at any
time during his investigation.” Doc. 35, Defs.' Objs. 5. Put
differently, Defendants argue that merely plugging different
dates into a computer program does not demonstrate that the
two-and-a-half-year delay resulted in prejudice to Plaintiff.
But Defendants take no issue with Phipps's use of Xactimate
generally to estimate repair costs. Rather, they object to the
implications of his calculations. The affidavit merely states
that Xactimate comes up with one number using June 2012
pricing and another number using January 2015 pricing. The
Court fails to see how these statements regarding calculations
performed by Phipps mischaracterize any facts in evidence.
In conclusion, Defendants' objections to Plaintiff's summary
judgment evidence, namely paragraphs 10, 11, 12, 13, and
16 in the affidavit of Derek Phipps, are OVERRULED with
the exception of paragraph 10(f), which the Court STRIKES
from the record. The Court turns now to the merits of
Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment.
B. Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment
Underwriters moves for summary judgment on Defendants'
counterclaims for breach of contract and violation of the
Texas Insurance Code. The Court reviews each of Defendants'
counterclaims in turn below.
1. Defendants' Breach of Contract Counterclaim
Defendants contend that the damage to their property was
the result of a hail storm that occurred during the policy
period, and therefore Plaintiff breached the insurance contract
when it denied Defendants' claim. Doc. 11, Defs. Answer &
Countercls. ¶ 46.
Under Texas law, “[a]n insurance policy is a contract and is
therefore subject to rules of contract interpretation.” F .D.I.C.
v. Firemen's Ins. C. of Newark, N.J. , 109 F.3d 1084, 1087
(5th Cir. 1997)  (citing Forbau v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. , 876
S.W.2d 132, 133 (Tex. 1994) ). “The elements of a breach
of contract claim are: (1) the existence of a valid contract;
(2) performance tendered by [Defendants]; (3) breach of the
contract by [Underwriters]; and (4) damages to [Defendants]
resulting from that breach.” Wright v. Christian & Smith, 950
S.W.2d 411, 412 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1997, no
writ). Further, “Texas law clearly states that for an insurance
company to be liable for a breach of its duty to satisfy a
claim presented by its insured, the insured must prove that its
claim falls within the insuring agreement of the policy.” Data
Specialties, Inc. v. Transcontinental Ins. Co. , 125 F.3d 909,
911 (5th Cir. 1997). And “[t]he insured bears the initial burden
of showing that there is coverage....” Primrose Operating Co.
v. Nat'l Am. Ins. Co., 382 F.3d 546, 553 (5th Cir. 2004). That
is to say that for Underwriters to be liable for breach of the
insurance contract, Defendants must first prove that the claim
was covered under the Policy.
Underwriters argues two grounds for summary judgment on
Defendants' breach of contract counterclaim. First, Plaintiff
argues that Defendants cannot prove that the claimed damage
resulted from a covered peril because Defendants have
provided no evidence segregating the damage attributable
to the June 13, 2012 storm from damage attributable to the
various other storms documented as occurring outside of the
policy period in the years before and after the Policy was in
effect. Doc. 46, Pl.'s Mot. 1–2. Second, Plaintiff contends that
Defendants failed to comply with their duty under the Policy
to provide prompt notice of the loss, which Plaintiff argues
prejudiced its ability to investigate the claim and increased
the cost to replace the roofs. Id. at 2. The Court considers the
parties' arguments below.
i. Covered loss
“An insured cannot recover under an insurance policy unless
facts are pleaded and proved showing that damages are
covered by his policy.” Emp'rs Cas. Co. v. Block, 744 S.W.2d
940, 944 (Tex. 1988) , overruled in part on other grounds
by State Farm Fire & Cas. v. Gandy , 925 S.W.2d 696 (Tex.
1996). To be sure, an insured who suffers damage from both
covered and excluded perils is not precluded from recovering
for the covered loss, but “[w]hen covered and excluded perils
combine to cause an injury, the insured must present some
evidence affording the jury a reasonable basis on which to
allocate the damage.” Lyons v. Miller Cas. Ins. Co. of Tex., 866
S.W.2d 597, 601 (Tex. 1993) . “[T]he burden of segregating
the damage attributable solely to the covered event is a
coverage issue for which the insured carries the burden of
proof.” One Way Invs., Inc. v. Century Sur. Co. , No. 3:14-
CV-2839-D, 2016 WL 5122124, at *2 (N.D. Tex. Sept. 21,
2016) (citing Wallis v. United Servs. Auto. Ass'n , 2 S.W.3d
300, 303 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1999, pet. denied)). And
“[f]ailure to provide evidence upon which a jury or court can
allocate damages between those that resulted from covered
perils and those that did not is fatal to an insured party's

## Page 7

claim.” Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa. v. Puget
Plastics Corp., 735 F. Supp. 2d 650, 669 (S.D. Tex. 2010).
*9  Here, Underwriters concedes that “the Policy covers
damage by a windstorm or hail event which occurred during
the Policy period—June 2, 2012 to June 2, 2013.” Doc.
47, Pl.'s Br. 11. But it argues that Defendants have failed
to provide any evidence either that the present damage is
solely due to the June 13, 2012 storm or upon which a
jury could reasonably allocate the present damage between
the June 2012 storm and several documented hail events
occurring outside the coverage period. Id. at 11–12. In
support, Underwriters points to the fact that Defendants' own
weather history reports—provided first to Desai and then by
Desai to the insurance agent—show eight hail events outside
of the policy period that could have caused the damage. Id.
Plaintiff also notes that Defendants didn't even select the
date of loss for the insurance claim themselves; rather, the
insurance agent selected the date after reviewing the weather
reports and seeing that one hail event occurred during the
policy period. Id. at 12.
Rather than pointing to evidence upon which a jury could
reasonably allocate damages, Defendants instead focus on
their contention that “all of [sic] damage was from the
June 13, 2012 storm.” Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp. 13. In support,
Defendants contend that Underwriters “was in possession
of at least three documents establishing June 13, 2012 as
the date of loss when they made the decision to deny
Defendants' claim.” Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp. 2. The three
documents Defendants reference are the damage estimate and
related computer log notes of Derek Phipps and the first
and second reports prepared by Haag Engineering. Id. As
discussed below, however, neither these documents nor any
other evidence submitted by Defendants raise a genuine issue
of material fact as to whether the damage was entirely due to
the June 13, 2012 storm or from which a jury could reasonably
segregate the damages between storms.
Beginning with the Phipps Damage Estimate and related
computer log notes, Defendants contend that Phipps “had no
problem connecting the hail damage to the 2012 storm.” Doc.
34, Defs.' Resp. 6. For support, Defendants point to the fact
that Phipps's estimate lists “June 13, 2012” in the “Date of
Loss” field, and a computer log note by Phipps on January 16,
2015, states that “[t]he roof materials are totaled by hail on the
reported and documented DOL.” Id. Contrary to Defendants'
contention that Phipps tied the damage to the June 2012
storm, however, Phipps's deposition is replete with testimony
that he was not making any recommendations with regard
to coverage, but instead was hired merely to investigate the
extent of the damage and estimate the cost to repair or replace
the roofs. See, e.g., Doc. 33, Defs.' App. 44, Ex. D, Dep. of
Derek Phipps (“Q: .... And you also made a recommendation
to Frontier about coverage? A: No. Just documented the
damage and made recommendations for repairs.”); id. at 83
(“Q: And you made those recommendations from damage by
hail as a result of the June 13th, 2012 storm; correct? A: Due
to hail damage. Q: But specifically due to the June 13th, 2012
storm; correct? A: At that time I wasn't questioning the date
of loss.”); id. at 119 (“Q: And were you able to determine,
during your inspection, when the hail damage was caused?
A: That wasn't part of my inspection.”); id. at 120 (“Q: So it
was clear to you at the time that the damage that you saw was
caused by hail? A: Yes. Q: And you just weren't sure when it
was caused? A: Correct.”).
As for the notation of “June 13, 2012” as the “Date of Loss”
on the estimate and in the computer log notes, Phipps testified
that he was merely repeating the date of loss provided to him.
Id. at 81 (“A: I did reference the provided date of loss because
I wasn't questioning that at the time.”); id. at 102 (“Q: .... The
only storm that you identified anywhere in your estimate, your
notes, your reports was the June 13th, 2012 storm; true? A:
That's the date of loss I used, yes. Just to be clear, I wasn't
there to determine the date of loss.”); id. at 124 (“Q: .... Just
tell us what you meant by that note, please. A: I just meant
that the hail—date of loss that was reported, there was hail on
that date.”); id. (“A: I guess I was just reiterating that the—
the date of loss that they gave to me that we documented, that
there was hail on that date.”).
*10  Far from establishing that Phipps attributed the damage
solely to the June 13, 2012 storm, the evidence merely
demonstrates that there was hail damage observed at the
property as of January 2015 and that weather history reports
reviewed by Phipps as part of his inspection confirmed that a
storm had occurred at the location on June 13, 2012, neither
of which Plaintiff contests. Defendants' attempt to conjure a
causation opinion out of Phipps's parroting the date of loss
he'd received with his assignment is unconvincing. Thus,
Phipps's estimate and log notes do little more than support
a point that is not actually in dispute—that the June 13,
2012 storm could have  caused the damage. “Whether the
storm actually did—and to what extent—remains unclear.”
Hamilton, 2014 WL 30555801, at *5 (emphasis added).

Turning to the Haag reports, Defendants argue that “Haag
concluded in their April 8, 2015 report (Report No. 1) that the
hail damage to the hotel was from the June 13, 2012 storm.”
Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp. 7. What the first Haag report actually
states is that the June 13, 2012 storm was “the most recent
hailstorm with hailstones large enough to cause the damage.”
Doc. 33, Defs.' App. 250, Ex. G, Haag Report No. 1 (emphasis
added). As mentioned above, Haag had also reviewed—
and provided to Underwriters as an attachment to its first
report—the same Weather Fusion/PointData weather history
information showing four other hail events with estimated
maximum hail size of greater than one inch at the property
prior to the coverage period. Id. at 263–64.
As for the second Haag report, Defendants make much of
the following statement: “We considered other sources of
information and they helped us confirm June 13, 2012 as
the most likely date damage occurred.” Doc. 33, Defs.' App.
363, Ex. H, Haag Report No. 2 (emphasis added). This
statement is unsurprising, however, considering the context
of the second Haag report, which was specifically addressing
“the likelihood that damage occurred between December 29,
2012 and December 29, 2014,” the two-year period prior to
the date the claim was filed. See id. Significantly, a subsequent
Haag report confirmed that “[t]here have been multiple hail
events at this location.” Doc. 33, Defs.' App. 372, Ex. I, Haag
Report No. 3. This third report noted that “[h]ail as great
as 1.50-inch diameter hail was reported on March 10, 2010,
4.25-inch diameter hail on May 24, 2011, 2.75-inch diameter
hail on April 3, 2012 and 2.75-inch diameter hail on June 13,
2012.” Id. at 371–72. All but the last are outside of the policy
period.
Additionally, a letter from Haag Engineering dated August 11,
2016, clarifies that Haag Report No. 2 “inadvertently referred
to June 13, 2012, as the ‘most likely’ date that damage
occurred instead of the ‘most recent,’ as was concluded in
[the] April 8, 2015, report.” Doc. 33, Defs.' App. 402, Ex.
J, Haag Report No. 4. The letter goes on to state that “it
was never our intention to suggest that June 13, 2012, was
the known date or the only date that dents/damage occurred
at this property” and that “[m]eteorological study has been
performed that identifies additional dates in [sic] which
conditions were conducive to hail at the site prior to June
2012.” Id. at 403. Plaintiff also provided an affidavit from
Timothy Marshall, Principal Engineer and Meteorologist at
Haag Engineering, dated May 20, 2016, reiterating that “hail
greater than one inch in diameter likely fell at the Property on
four dates: a) March 10, 2010, b) May 24, 2011, c) April 3,
2012, and d) June 13, 2012.” Doc. 48, Pl.'s App. 245, Ex. L,
Aff. of Timothy Marshall.
Defendants submitted several supplemental documents
from Frontier Adjusters and Peninsula Insurance Bureau
which Defendants argue demonstrate that “the damage to
Defendants' property was caused by a hail storm on June
13, 2012” and that “Plaintiffs [sic] disregarded their own
adjuster and expert when they wrongfully denied Defendants'
claim.” Doc. 78-1, Defs.' Mot. for Leave to File Suppl.
Record 2. According to Defendants, these documents show
that Plaintiff “conducted a result-oriented investigation, first
deciding they would not pay the claim and then seeking
evidence to justify [its] position.” Id. at 4. Thus, Defendants
appear to infer from these letters and computer log notes
between Frontier Adjusters and Peninsula Insurance Bureau
regarding the progress of the claim that, because these third-
parties took steps to investigate and estimate the claimed
damage, they must have attributed the damage to the June
2012 storm, which Plaintiff then ignored.
*11  First, the Court notes that whether an insurer ignores a
third-party adjuster's recommendation regarding coverage is
irrelevant to the inquiry of whether the damage is ultimately
covered by the policy. For instance, an insurer may hire
twenty adjusters that all tell it that the damage is covered.
But if they all happen to be wrong, the damage is still not
covered. Thus, the insurer could not be held liable for breach
of the insurance contract for denying the claim. Such evidence
would seem more relevant to a common law bad faith or
statutory violation claim.
Second, far from establishing that the damage was due solely
to the June 2012 storm, Defendants' supplemental documents
actually support Plaintiff's position that it questioned the date
of loss prior to denying the claim based on the lapse of time
between the reported date of loss and the date the claim was
filed. See, e.g., Doc. 79, Defs.' Suppl. Records, Ex. B at 15
(computer log note dated June 11, 2015, from employee of
Frontier Adjusters documenting Underwriters's request for
additional investigation of “any hail storms” occurring “for
two years prior to” the date of claim and inquiry into “[h]ow
much damage would they have caused”). Thus, the Court
finds that these documents bring Defendants no closer to
establishing June 13, 2012, as the sole cause of damage, or to
providing a reasonable basis upon which a fact finder could
segregate the damage between the June 2012 storm and other
storms noted in the various weather reports in the record and
in Underwriters's possession at the time the claim was denied.

In sum, Underwriters has provided competent summary
judgment evidence that a non-covered peril—namely
multiple hail events outside the coverage period—could have
caused the damage. Therefore, “[Defendants] had the burden
of establishing evidence to allow the jury to segregate covered
losses from non-covered losses.” Atwill v. State Farm Lloyds,
No. 304CV1343-K, 2006 WL 1118155, at *2 (N.D. Tex.
Apr. 27, 2006) . But Defendants have provided no evidence
of the condition of the roofs either immediately before
or immediately after the June 2012 storm. “Federal courts
applying Texas law have held that summary judgment is
appropriate in cases where [parties] fail to raise a genuine
issue regarding the amount of damage attributable to covered
losses.” Clements v. State Farm Lloyds, No. H-05-0923, 2006
WL 5157426, at *13 (S.D. Tex. July 25, 2006) (citing Fiess v.
State Farm Lloyds, 392 F.3d 802, 807, 808 (5th Cir. 2004) );
Garza v. Allstate Tex. Lloyds, No. Civ.A.M-04-270, 2005 WL
2388254, at *4 (S.D. Tex. Sept. 28, 2005)  (“As [insurer]
has provided some evidence that excluded perils caused the
damage in question, and as [insured] has failed to set forth
any evidence that would allow the trier of fact to segregate
covered losses from uncovered losses, the Court GRANTS
[insurer's] Motion for Summary Judgment as to [insured's] ...
claim.”).
Because Defendants have failed to provide any evidence that
would allow the trier of fact to segregate covered losses from
non-covered losses, the Court concludes they have failed to
raise a genuine issue of material fact on this point. As a result,
Plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment on Defendants'
breach of contract counterclaim for this reason alone.
ii. Prompt notice
Although the Court's conclusion above is dispositive of
Defendants' breach of contract counterclaim, the Court
nevertheless considers Underwriters's “prompt notice”
argument for summary judgment as well. The Policy provides
that in the event of loss or damage, Defendants must “[g]ive
[Underwriters] prompt notice of the loss or damage.” Doc.
48, Pl.'s App. 141, Ex. D, Building and Personal Property
Coverage Form. Underwriters contends that Defendants
failed to comply with this provision by not reporting the
damage for over 30 months, which Underwriters argues
prejudiced it in two ways: (1) by depriving it of the
opportunity to fairly investigate the cause, nature, and extent
of the loss closer in time to when it allegedly occurred; and
(2) by increasing the cost to repair the damage. Doc. 47, Pl.'s
Br. 1–2. Accordingly, Underwriters contends it was relieved
of any obligation to perform under the Policy. Id. at 2. In
other words, Underwriters argues it was not required to pay
the claim because Defendants breached the “prompt notice”
provision of the Policy.
*12  Defendants, on the other hand, argue that “[t]he nature
of the loss was such that it was not immediately discoverable”
and that Defendants “reported the loss reasonably promptly
after they learned about the damage” in November 2014. Doc.
34, Defs.' Resp. 2. Moreover, according to Defendants, “any
delay on the part of Defendants in reporting the loss resulted
in no prejudice to Certain Underwriters, or at the very least
there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Certain
Underwriters was prejudiced.” Id.
As the parties appear to acknowledge, Texas has adopted
a notice-prejudice rule when analyzing notice provisions in
occurrence-based insurance policies like this one. See P AJ,
Inc. v. Hanover Ins. Co. , 243 S.W.3d 630, 634–35 (Tex.
2008); see also Ridglea Estate Condo. Ass'n v. Lexington
Ins. Co., 415 F.3d 474, 479–80 (5th Cir. 2005). Accordingly,
demonstrating the insured's late notice of a claim alone is
not enough to support an insurer's defense that the insured
breached the policy's notice requirement; rather, the insurer
must also establish that it was prejudiced by such delay. See
Ridglea, 415 F.3d at 479–80. As explained below, the Court
finds that Underwriters has met both prongs.
a. Unreasonable delay
The parties do not dispute the date of the alleged loss—June
13, 2012—or the date Defendants first provided notice of the
damage to Underwriters—December 29, 2014, the date of the
claim. They simply disagree on whether this delay of over two
and a half years violates the “prompt notice” requirement in
the Policy.
The Policy does not define “prompt notice,” but “Texas courts
have held that where ‘the policy does not define the term
“prompt,” [courts] construe the term as meaning that notice
must be given within a reasonable time after the occurrence.’
” Ridglea Estate Condo. Ass'n v. Lexington Ins. Co. , 415
F.3d 474, 479 (5th Cir. 2005)  (quoting Stonewall Ins. Co. v.
Modern Expl., Inc., 757 S.W.2d 432, 435 (Tex. App.—Dallas
1988, no writ)). And in cases with similar policy language to
the language here, the Supreme Court of Texas has held that

## Page 10

 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 10
property damage “occurs” when actual physical damage to the
property occurs. See Don's Bldg. Supply, Inc. v. OneBeacon
Ins. Co., 267 S.W.3d 20, 23–30 (Tex. 2008). Thus, in this case,
the damage occurred on June 13, 2012, the date of the storm
that Defendants allege caused the actual physical damage to
the property.
“While generally a question of fact, reasonableness becomes
a question of law if the facts are undisputed.” Alaniz v.
Sirius Int'l Ins. Corp., 626 Fed.Appx. 73, 76 (5th Cir. 2015).
Other courts have held that similar periods of time were not
prompt—i.e., not reasonable—as a matter of law in cases
involving hail damage. See, e.g. , id. at 76–78  (affirming
district court finding that notice was not prompt as a matter
of law where hail storm occurred in March 2012 but insured
did not provide notice until February 2014); Herrera v. State
Farm Lloyds , No. 5:15-cv-148, 2016 WL 1076911, at *3
(S.D. Tex. Mar. 18, 2016)  (holding that almost two years
between storm and notice was “unreasonable as a matter of
law”); Montemayor v. State Farm Lloyds , No. 1:15-cv-173,
2016 WL 4921553, at *2–3 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 7, 2016) (finding
two-year delay unreasonable as a matter of law); Gayton v.
Great Lakes Reinsurance (UK) PLC, No. 7:14-CV-229, 2014
WL 12538129, at *3–4 (S.D. Tex. Aug. 11, 2014) (“Because
the ... delay of almost two years is totally unexplained and
without excuse, the Court finds the delay unreasonable as a
matter of law.”); Galvan v. Great Lakes Reinsurance PLC ,
No. 7:14-CV-465, 2015 WL 12552009, at *2–3 (S.D. Tex.
Apr. 15, 2015) (“While there is no bright line rule, the Court
finds that waiting eighteen months to report a loss, especially
when no excuse is proffered for the delay, is not ‘prompt’ as
a matter of law.”). And in a case with strikingly similar facts
to those of this case, this Court has previously held that 19
months was not prompt as a matter of law. Hamilton, 2014
WL 3055801, at *8.
*13  Defendants attempt to distinguish these cases from
the present facts by arguing that the 30-month delay should
be excused because Defendants “did not initially notice
the damage” and because, according to Defendants, “[a]
reasonable policyholder cannot report a loss that they could
not have reasonably discovered yet.” Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp.
16, 17. Defendants offer the following facts in support of their
argument: (1) “the hail damage did not cause interior leaks to
the hotel which would have put Defendants on notice of the
damage”; (2) “Defendants do not conduct routine inspection
of the roofs because they can only be accessed by a crane
or lift”; (3) “Defendants did not have a protocol to evaluate
the hotel after hail storms”; and (4) “Defendants were not
aware that the hail storm had been severe enough to cause
any damage to the roof.” Id. at 16. Indeed, Mr. Desai was
apparently totally oblivious to the fact that a hail storm—
which totaled the hotel's roofs—had even occurred. See Doc.
33, Defs.' App. 6, Ex. B, Aff. of Ajay Desai ¶ 4 (“I was
not aware of the damage to the property caused by the June
13, 2012 hailstorm until November 2014. At the time of the
storm in 2012, no guests reported damage to their vehicles or
other property caused by hail. Likewise, none of my staff or
employees reported any damage or water leaks to the hotel
caused by hail. I am also not aware of any other businesses
in the area that sustained damages from the storm.”); see
also id. at 28, Ex. C, Exam. Under Oath of Ajay Desai (“Q:
Do you have any personal recollection of the hailstorm that
occurred on—supposedly occurred—here in the area on June
13, 2012? A: No. Q: Don't remember it? A: Don't remember
it.”). In essence, Defendants argue their good faith and a sort
of discovery rule should toll their “reasonable” time period
for reporting the damage.
Overlooking Defendants' apparent lack of routine
preventative maintenance protocols as to their roofs, as well
as evidence that the damage was visible to the naked eye from
the ground,8 the Court notes that Texas law requires prompt
notice “within a reasonable time after the occurrence,” not
within a reasonable time of discovery of the damage. Ridglea,
415 F.3d at 479 (emphasis added). “The date that the physical
damage is or could have been discovered is irrelevant....”
Don's Bldg. Supply , 267 S.W.3d at 24 ; Hamilton, 2014 WL
3055801, at *8  (finding plaintiff's insistence that he gave
notice “as soon as he reasonably realized that a covered claim
may exist” insufficient). As established above, the damage
“occurred” in this case, according to Defendants, on June 13,
2012. Thus, the Court has no problem finding that Defendants'
notice—given over 30 months after the damage allegedly
occurred—was not prompt as a matter of law. See Hamilton,
2014 WL 3055801, at *8 . Having found that Defendants'
notice of the claim was not prompt as a matter of law, the
Court now considers whether Underwriters was prejudiced by
the late notice.
b. Prejudice
*14  As noted above, Underwriters must also show that it
was prejudiced by Defendants' late notice. See Ridglea, 415
F.3d at 479–80. Underwriters relies primarily on the affidavit
of Derek Phipps to demonstrate how it was prejudiced by
Defendants' late notice of hail damage. First, Underwriters

## Page 11

 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 11
points to the ways Phipps's inspection was impacted, such
as his inability to document the condition of the roofs
until more than two years after the alleged date of loss or
to determine how the roofs had been impacted by other
weather events or non-covered perils such as wear and tear
in the intervening time period. Doc. 47, Pl.'s Br. 15 (citing
Doc. 48, Pl.'s App. 212–15, Ex. H, Aff. of Derek Phipps).
Second, Underwriters argues that Defendants' late notice
“also prejudiced Underwriters[ ] because the cost to repair
the damage to the Property increased significantly during
the thirty-month delay.” Id. at 16. As evidence, Underwriters
points to the calculations of Derek Phipps, described in
Phipps's affidavit, using Xactimate to show that the estimate
would have been $47,802.67 less if the claim was reported
immediately following the loss so that Phipps could have used
June 2012 pricing data rather than January 2015 pricing data.
Id. at 17 (citing Doc. 48, Pl.'s App. 212–15, Ex. H, Aff. of
Derek Phipps). Accordingly, Underwriters contends it was
“relieved of any obligation to perform under the contract and
[is] entitled to summary judgment on Defendants' breach of
contract [counter]claim.” Doc. 46, Pl.'s Mot. 2.
Defendants respond that “any delay on the part of Defendants
in reporting the loss resulted in no prejudice to Certain
Underwriters, or at the very least there is a genuine
issue of material fact as to whether Certain Underwriters
was prejudiced.”  Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp. 2. According to
Defendants, while late notice may create an environment
where prejudice can occur, Underwriters has failed to bridge
the gap to demonstrate that it occurred in this case. Id. at
19 (citing Trumble, 304 Fed.Appx. at 244 ). As discussed
above, Defendants attempt to refute statements in Phipps's
affidavit that he had difficulty investigating the damage with
the fact that he was ultimately able to complete an estimate
of the cost to replace the damaged roofs. See id. at 19–20. 9
Thus, Defendants reason that because Phipps was able to
provide an estimate of the cost to replace the damage he
observed in January 2015 to Frontier Adjusters, who then
passed the estimate along to Peninsula Insurance Bureau
and ultimately to Underwriters, Phipps's investigation—and
therefore Underwriters's investigation—must not have been
prejudiced. Therefore, Defendants insist summary judgment
is inappropriate.
“When an insurer must prove it was prejudiced by the
insured's failure to comply with the notice provisions, ‘the
recognized purposes of the notice requirements form the
boundaries of the insurer's argument that it was prejudiced;
a showing of prejudice generally requires a showing that
one of the recognized purposes has been impaired.’ ”
Blanton v. Vesta Lloyds Ins. Co. , 185 S.W.3d 607, 612
(Tex. App.—Dallas 2006, no pet.)  (quoting 13 Couch on
Insurance § 186:14 (3d ed. 2005)). “The purpose of the notice
requirement is to enable an insurer to promptly investigate
the circumstances of an accident while the matter is still
fresh in the minds of the witnesses, to prevent fraud, and
to enable [the insurer] to form an intelligent estimate of its
rights and liabilities under the policy so that it may adequately
prepare to defend any claim that may arise.” Stonewall, 757
S.W.2d at 435 (citing Weaver v. Hartford Accident & Indem.
Co., 570 S.W.2d 367, 369 (Tex. 1978) ; Emp'rs Cas. Co. v.
Glen Falls Ins. Co., 484 S.W.2d 570, 575 (Tex. 1972)). Thus,
“prejudice from failure to notify timely arises from inability
to investigate the circumstances of an occurrence and prepare
adequately to adjust or defend any claims....” Blanton, 185
S.W.3d at 615.
But “an insurer must offer ‘more than the mere fact that it
cannot employ its normal procedures in investigating and
evaluating the claim.’ ” Trumble Steel Erectors, Inc. v. Moss,
304 Fed.Appx. 236, 244 (5th Cir. 2008) (per curiam) (quoting
Transportes Ferreos de Venezuela II CA v. NKK Corp. , 239
F.3d 555, 561 (3d Cir. 2001)). The insurer must show that it
was prejudiced “in some tangible way.” Berkley Reg'l Ins. Co.
v. Phila. Indem. Ins. Co., 690 F.3d 342, 349 (5th Cir. 2012) .
Though the existence of prejudice is generally a fact question,
the Court may decide the issue on summary judgment “if
the undisputed facts establish prejudice sufficient to relieve
an insurer of its obligations.” St. Paul Guardian Ins. Co. v.
Centrum G.S. Ltd., 383 F. Supp. 2d 891, 902 (N.D. Tex. 2003).
*15  Other courts have held that an affidavit from an insurer
listing the ways that an insured's failure to give prompt notice
prejudiced the insurer “was sufficient to establish prejudice as
a matter of law.” See, e.g., Camacho v. Allstate Texas Lloyds,
No. 7:14-CV-581, 2015 WL 12532486, at *3 (S.D. Tex. May
20, 2015) (“This Court has previously held that an affidavit
from a claims manager for the defendant insurer listing
the ways that the plaintiff's failure to give prompt notice
prejudiced the insurer was sufficient to establish prejudice
as a matter of law under the facts of that case.” ). The Court
has already noted that the simple fact that an estimate of
damages was “completed” says nothing of that investigation's
quality. See Hamilton, 2014 WL 3055801, at *10 . Instead,
Phipps explains in both his affidavit and his deposition how
his investigation was impacted. See Doc. 48, Pl.'s App. 212–
15, Ex. H, Aff. of Derek Phipps; see also  Doc. 33, Defs.'
App. 131–33, Ex. D, Dep. of Derek Phipps. “[P]rejudice from

## Page 12

Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London v. Lowen Valley..., Not Reported in Fed....
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 12
failure to notify timely arises from the inability to investigate
the circumstances of an occurrence to prepare adequately to
adjust or defend any claim....” Blanton, 185 S.W.3d at 615
(emphasis added). Thus, Defendants' attempt to twist the fact
that Phipps was able to provide a damage estimate into an
opinion that the damage he saw was due to the storm on
the date of loss provided to him and that, therefore, he must
have been able to complete a full and fair investigation is
unpersuasive.
Yet even if the Court were to disregard Phipps's sworn
testimony as to how his inspection was impacted by the delay,
the Court would still find as a matter of law that the late notice
resulted in tangible prejudice to Underwriters because the
evidence shows that the cost to repair the damage increased
by $47,802.67, or roughly ten percent, between June 2012
and January 2015. Underwriters provided evidence, utilizing
the Xactimate estimating program, that if Defendants had
reported the loss immediately after the June 2012 storm, the
cost to repair the damage would have been $424,225.41 at
that time. Doc. 47, Pl.'s Br. 17 (citing Doc. 48, Pl.'s App.
212–15, Ex. H, Aff. of Derek Phipps; id. at 250–257, Ex. N,
Phipps Damage Estimate (June 2012 pricing)). But because
Defendants reported the loss on December 29, 2014, the cost
to complete the same repairs using January 2015 pricing was
$472,028.08. Id. (citing Doc. 48, Pl.'s App. 212–15, Ex. H,
Aff. of Derek Phipps; id. at 231–38, Ex. J, Phipps Damage
Estimate (January 2015 pricing)).
As noted above, Defendants do not appear to take issue with
Plaintiff's use of Xactimate in general or even the estimates it
generated in this case specifically. Rather, Defendants argue
that “[t]he fact that Phipps could have used the June 2012
Xactimate pricing at any point during the investigation, is
actually proof that Certain Underwriters could have avoided
any prejudice caused by the time delay.” Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp.
21. Confusingly, Defendants appear to argue that because
Underwriters has no evidence of how the condition of the
roofs changed between the time of the June 2012 storm and
the time Defendants filed their claim—because Defendants
did not report the damage for over two and a half years—
that Underwriters cannot show that the cost to repair the
damage increased during that time. On the contrary, the Court
can imagine no better evidence of tangible prejudice than
pricing data demonstrating that the cost to repair the damage
increased during the period of delay, regardless of whether the
condition of the roofs changed during that period.
Furthermore, Plaintiff would have had no reason to use the
June 2012 pricing “at any point during the investigation”
because there was not even an insurance claim until December
29, 2014. Therefore, construing the facts in the light most
favorable to Defendants, the Court finds as a matter of law
that Underwriters was prejudiced by Defendants' failure to
provide prompt notice. Thus, Plaintiff is entitled to summary
judgment on Defendants' breach of contract counterclaim on
this ground as well.
2. Defendants' Texas Insurance Code Counterclaims
The Court turns next to Defendants' counterclaims for
violations of the Texas Insurance Code and Underwriters's
motion for summary judgment thereupon. Defendants
contend that Underwriters “violated several provisions of
Texas Insurance Code § 541.060 by, among other things (1)
conducting an unreasonable, untimely, and results-oriented
investigation; (2) refusing to affirm or deny coverage within
a reasonable time; and (3) attempting to coerce Defendants
into accepting a grossly unfair and inadequate offer and
signing a release.” Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp. 29–30. Regarding
their § 542 counterclaims, Defendants argue Underwriters
“failed to timely acknowledge the claim, failed to conduct
a reasonable and timely investigation, and refused to affirm
or deny coverage within a reasonable time in violation of
Chapter 542 of the Texas Insurance Code, known as the Texas
‘Prompt Payment of Claims Act’ (PPCA).” Id. at 31.
*16  Underwriters moved for summary judgment on
each of these counterclaims, arguing that Defendants'
Insurance Code claims necessarily fail because the breach of
contract counterclaim fails and Defendants cannot show any
independent injury outside of the claim for benefits under the
Policy. Doc. 47, Pl.'s Br. 18–19. According to Underwriters,
because the loss was not covered under the Policy, Defendants
cannot recover for a statutory violation without injury
independent of the policy benefits, which Defendants
cannot, or at least have not, shown. For the reasons that
follow, the Court agrees with Underwriters. Therefore,
summary judgment in favor of Underwriters is warranted on
Defendants' Texas Insurance Code counterclaims.
i. Section 541
Defendants contend that Underwriters breached § 541 of
the Texas Insurance Code by “disregard[ing] all evidence in
[its] possession which clearly established that Defendants'

## Page 13

Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London v. Lowen Valley..., Not Reported in Fed....
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 13
loss was a covered loss,” by “delay[ing] communicating a
coverage decision to the insured for almost 15 months,” and
by “attempting to coerce [Defendants] to settle the claim
for an amount lower than the covered damages and to sign
a complete release of liability by threatening to pursue a
declaratory judgment action.” Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp. 30, 31.
Section 541 prohibits an insurer from “failing to attempt
in good faith to effectuate a prompt, fair, and equitable
settlement of ... a claim with respect to which the insurer's
liability has become reasonably clear” or “refusing to pay
a claim without conducting a reasonable investigation with
respect to the claim.” Tex. Ins. Code Ann. § 541.060(a)(2)
(A), (7). Other prohibited conduct includes failing to affirm
or deny coverage or submit a reservation of rights to a
policyholder within a reasonable time, or “undertaking to
enforce a full and final release of a claim from a policyholder
when only a partial payment has been made, unless the
payment is a compromise settlement of a doubtful or disputed
claim.” Id. § 541.060(4), (6).
Liability under § 541 of the Texas Insurance Code is analyzed
under the same standard as common-law bad faith claims.
See Hamilton Props. v. Am. Ins. Co., 643 Fed.Appx. 437, 442
(5th Cir. 2016) (citing Tex. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sara Care Child
Care Ctr., Inc., 324 S.W.3d 305, 317 (Tex. App.—El Paso
2010, pet. denied)). An insurer breaches its common law duty
of good faith and fair dealing “if the insurer knew or should
have known that it was reasonably clear that the claim was
covered,” but nevertheless denied or unreasonably delayed
paying it. Universe Life Ins. Co. v. Giles , 950 S.W.2d 48,
55–56 (Tex. 1997). “Evidence establishing only a bona fide
coverage dispute does not demonstrate bad faith.” State Farm
Fire & Cas. Co. v. Simmons, 963 S.W.2d 42, 44 (Tex. 1998).
Generally, “there can be no claim for bad faith when an insurer
has promptly denied a claim that is in fact not covered.”
Republic Ins. Co. v. Stoker, 903 S.W.2d 338, 341 (Tex. 1995).
An exception exists, however, when an insurer's conduct is
“so extreme, that it would cause injury independent of the
policy claim.” Id. (citing Aranda v. Ins. Co. of N. Am. , 748
S.W.2d 210, 214 (Tex. 1988), overruled on other grounds by
Tex. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Ruttiger, 381 S.W.3d 430 (Tex. 2012)).
Underwriters argues that Defendants have neither alleged nor
proven that they suffered any injury independent of the denial
of policy benefits. Doc. 47, Pl.'s Br. 19. Therefore, according
to Underwriters, because Defendants cannot prevail on their
breach of contract counterclaim, they likewise cannot succeed
on their extra-contractual claims under the Texas Insurance
Code. Id. at 18–20. Defendants, for their part, argue that the
confusing state of Texas law regarding whether “independent
injury” is required when the only damages sought are unpaid
coverage benefits necessitates that this Court hold off on
deciding the motion for summary judgment until the Texas
Supreme Court issues its opinion in USAA Tex. Lloyds Co. v.
Menchaca, which addressed the exact question at issue here.
Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp. 23.
*17  Fortunately, the Texas Supreme Court delivered its
opinion in Menchaca on April 7, 2017. See USAA Tex. Lloyds
Co. v. Menchaca, No. 14-0721, 2017 WL 1311752 (Tex. Apr.
7, 2017) . In Menchaca, the Supreme Court articulated the
issue as follows:
The primary question in this case is whether an insured
can recover policy benefits as actual damages caused by an
insurer's statutory violation absent a finding that the insured
had a contractual right to the benefits under the insurance
policy.
Id. at *4. After reaffirming the general rule that “an insured
cannot recover policy benefits as damages for an insurer's
statutory violation if the policy does not provide the insured a
right to receive those benefits,” the court went on to clarify the
application of the “independent injury” rule. Id. According
to Menchaca, “if an insurer's statutory violation causes an
injury independent of the loss of policy benefits, the insured
may recover damages for that injury even if the policy does
not grant the insured a right to benefits.” Id. Or stated in
the negative, “an insured cannot recover any damages based
on an insurer's statutory violation if the insured had no right
to receive benefits under the policy and sustained no injury
independent of a right to benefits.” Id.
Here, the Court has already determined that Defendants
have failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact on
their counterclaim for breach of contract. In other words,
Defendants have not demonstrated that the claimed damage
was “covered” under the Policy. Or in the language of
Menchaca, they have not demonstrated a “right to receive
benefits under the policy.” Id. Therefore, Defendants' only
route to damages for a statutory violation would be to
demonstrate that they suffered an “injury independent of a
right to benefits.” Id.
Defendants have provided no evidence, and indeed do not
even attempt to argue, that Underwriters's conduct was “so
extreme” as to cause “injury independent of a right to
benefits” under the Policy. Stoker, 903 S.W.2d at 341. Rather,

## Page 14

 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 14
Defendants argue that “the so-called ‘independent injury’
rule ... simply does not apply to cases like this one ... where
the actual damages sought are coverage benefits due under the
policy.” Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp. 24. Thus, Defendants assume
independent injury is not required in this case because they
assume the claimed damages are covered.
Yet the Court has concluded that the claimed damages are
not covered as a matter of law. So independent injury is
required. And Defendants have failed to provide any evidence
to raise a fact issue that the alleged statutory violations caused
any injury independent of the policy benefits sought. See
Mid–Continent Cas. Ins. Co. v. Eland Energy, Inc., 709 F.3d
515, 521 (5th Cir. 2013) (observing that “in seventeen years
since [ Stoker,] no Texas court has yet held that recovery
is available for an insurer's extreme act....”). Therefore,
without addressing whether the specific alleged conduct
would constitute a violation of § 541, the Court finds that
Underwriters is entitled to summary judgment on Defendants'
§ 541 counterclaims because Defendants cannot succeed on
their breach of contract claim as a matter of law, and they
have provided no evidence of injury independent of the policy
benefits.
ii. Section 542
*18  The Court next considers Defendants' counterclaim
that Underwriters violated § 542 of the Insurance Code.
Defendants contend that, “[i]n addition to breaching the
contract and failing to pay a covered claim in bad faith
violation of Chapter 541, Certain Underwriters failed to
timely acknowledge the claim, failed to conduct a reasonable
and timely investigation, and refused to affirm or deny
coverage within a reasonable time in violation of Chapter
542 of the Texas Insurance Code, known as the Texas
‘Prompt Payment of Claims Act’ (PPCA).” Doc. 34, Defs.'
Resp. 31. Defendants argue that between the date of the
Reservation of Rights Letter in March 2015 and the request
for an Examination Under Oath of Desai in December
2015, Underwriters “inspected the property several times
but never provided [Defendants] with any of the several
reports and estimates Certain Underwriters obtained.” Id.
at 32. According to Defendants, “[a]ll evidence discovered
during their investigation indicated that [Defendants'] loss
was covered, but Certain Underwriters delayed making a
coverage decision” and eventually “disregarded all evidence
in their possession” and denied the claim. Id.
“The Prompt Payment of Claims Act prohibits insurers from
delaying the payment of first-party claims.” Trammel Crow
Residential Co. v. Va. Sur. Co., 643 F. Supp. 2d 844, 857 (N.D.
Tex. 2008) (citing Tex. Ins. Code Ann. §§ 542.051 –.061).
It “establishes a series of claim-handling and claim-payment
deadlines for insurers” and “provides additional damages
when an insurer wrongfully refuses or delays payment of a
claim.” Weiser-Brown Operating Co. v. St. Paul Surplus Lines
Ins. Co. , 801 F.3d 512, 518 (5th Cir. 2015)  (citing Lamar
Homes, Inc. v. Mid-Continent Cas. Co. , 242 S.W.3d 1, 16
(Tex. 2007)). “[T]o maintain a claim under Chapter 542 of the
Texas Insurance Code, a party must show: (1) ‘a “first-party”
claim under an insurance policy’; (2) ‘the insurer's liability for
that claim’; and (3) ‘the insurer's failure to follow one or more
sections of the statute with respect to handling that claim.’
” Johnson v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Ind. , No. 3:15-CV-1939-B,
2017 WL 879211, at *10 (N.D. Tex. Mar. 6, 2017)  (citing
Hulcher Servs., Inc. v. Great Am. Ins. Co., No. 4:14-CV-231,
2015 WL 3921903, at *11 (E.D. Tex. June 25, 2015); Weiser-
Brown, 801 F.3d at 518). In other words, liability for the claim
is a precondition to liability under Chapter 542. Id. (citing
Wellisch v. United Servs. Auto. Ass'n , 75 S.W.3d 53, 57 n.2
(Tex. App.—San Antonio 2002, pet. denied)).
Again without reaching the merits, the Court can quickly
dispose of Defendants' Chapter 542 counterclaim. Here, the
Court has already determined that Defendants cannot succeed
on their breach of contract counterclaim as a matter of law.
Therefore, they cannot show that the insurer is “liable for
the claim,” as is required to prove a violation of § 542.
Accordingly, in light of the Court's previous determination
that Underwriters is not liable for Defendants' claim under
the Policy, Underwriters is entitled to summary judgment on
Defendants' counterclaim for violation of § 542 of the Texas
Insurance Code.
3. Declaratory Judgment
This lawsuit originated as a declaratory judgment action
by Underwriters, asking for “judgment against Defendants
declaring that there is no coverage under policy number
NJL440003612 for the reported hail damage because
Defendants violated the policy's notice condition and
Underwriters suffered prejudice as a result.” Doc. 1, Original
Compl. & Req. for Declaratory J. ¶ 21; see also  Doc. 23,
1st Am. Original Compl. & Req. for Declaratory J. ¶ 22
(requesting same). In response, Defendants, in addition to
filing the counterclaims for breach of contract and violations
of the Texas Insurance Code addressed above, requested a
declaratory judgment of their own: “that the Policy provides

## Page 15

Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London v. Lowen Valley..., Not Reported in Fed....
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 15
coverage for the cost to repair the damaged property, less only
a deductible, among other things.” Doc. 11, Defs.' Answer &
Countercls. ¶ 45.
Underwriters did not mention its request for, or Defendants'
counterclaim for, declaratory judgment in its motion
for summary judgment. But “district courts are widely
acknowledged to possess the power to enter summary
judgments sua sponte , so long as the losing party was on
notice that [it] had to come forward with all of [its] evidence.”
Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 326 (1986).
*19  The Fifth Circuit “has reversed summary judgment were
a moving party's memorandum failed to raise a point ‘in a
manner that would be sufficient to put the [non-moving party]
on notice that failure to present evidence of [the elements of
each of its claims] could be grounds for summary judgment.’
” Tramago, L.P . v. Euler-Hermes Am. Credit Indem. Co., 602
Fed.Appx. 981, 984 (5th Cir. 2015) (quoting John Deere Co.
v. Am. Nat'l Bank, Stafford , 809 F.2d 1190, 1191 (5th Cir.
1987)). But that is not the case here.
The whole purpose of Underwriters's declaratory judgment
action was to secure a finding that the Policy did not provide
coverage for the claimed loss. Defendants, on the other hand,
requested the opposite declaration—a finding of coverage.
Because resolution of the parties' respective declaratory
judgment claims amounts simply to a resolution of the
coverage issue, the Court finds that Plaintiff's motion for
summary judgment on Defendants' counterclaim for breach
of contract was sufficient to put Defendants on notice that
they needed to bring all of their evidence in support of their
requested declaration of coverage. Thus, in holding above that
Defendants cannot succeed as a matter of law on their breach
of contract counterclaim, the Court has in effect declared “no
coverage.” Therefore, the Court finds that Defendants were
“on notice that [they] had to come forward with all of their
evidence.” Thomas v. EMC Mortg. Corp., 499 Fed.Appx. 337,
341 (5th Cir. 2012)  (quoting Celotex, 477 U.S. at 326 ). For
that reason, summary judgment in favor of Underwriters on
the claims for declaratory relief is also warranted at this time.
IV .
CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, summary judgment is
GRANTED in favor of Underwriters on Defendants'
counterclaims for breach of the insurance contract and
violations of the Texas Insurance Code, and these claims
are DISMISSED with prejudice . Accordingly, the Court
also GRANTS summary judgment sua sponte  in favor
Underwriters on its request for declaratory relief and
DENIES sua sponte  Defendants' request for declaratory
relief.10 An Order of Final Judgment will follow.
SO ORDERED.

1 This factual history is drawn from the parties' summary judgment briefing and evidence, as well as their pleadings. Any
disputed fact is noted as the contention of a particular party.
2 There does not appear to be any significance to the beginning date of the roofer's search, January 1, 2006. And the only
significance of December 21, 2014, appears to be that it was the day before the report was requested.
3 Though it does not appear to be a point of contention between the parties, there is some confusion as to the actual date
of Phipps's inspection. Plaintiff indicates the inspection took place on January 12, 2015. Doc. 47, Pl.'s Br. 4. Defendants
state it took place on January 16, 2015. Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp. 5. Phipps's actual report provides a “Date Inspected” of
January 14, 2015. Doc. 48, Pl.'s App. 232. For what it's worth, Phipps's affidavit indicates he inspected the property on
January 12, 2015. Doc. 48, Pl.'s App. 214, Ex. H, Aff. of Derek Phipps ¶ 6. Suffice it to say his investigation took place
in mid-January.
4 From the evidence it appears that Phipps's Damage Estimate includes only the cost to replace the roofs, not the cost
to repair the damage to the exterior siding. Apparently, Phipps was waiting to hear back from other contractors before
submitting an estimate for the siding, but it does not appear that he ever heard back from the contractors or submitted an

updated estimate. See Doc. 33, Defs.' App. 412, Ex. K, Phipps Computer Log Notes (entry from Jan. 16, 2015, stating
“The exterior EIFS has hail damage on each elevation requiring repairs and bids from two local stucco/eifs contractors....
IA is coordinating with contractor and owner/insured to obtain the exterior bids.”); id. at 150, Ex. E, Phipps Damage
Estimate (noting that certain work referenced in the estimate was to be “performed by the roofing contractor” and thus
would not be “included in the exterior EIFS repair bid amount”); id. at 71, Ex. D, Dep. of Derek Phipps (“A: So before I
made a recommendation, I just requested that a stucco/EIFS professional give their recommendation for it....”); id. at 82
(“Q: ... just so I'm clear on this, this estimate that you prepared is the hail damage that you saw at the Hilton Garden Inn
to the three roof systems? A: Correct.”); id. at 86 (“Q: Okay. And did you ever get a copy of the EIFS damage estimate
from the contractor? A: I did not. Q: Do you recall sending any subsequent reports to either Frontier or their carrier after
your initial report on January 19th of 2015? A: I do not.”).
5 Underwriters subsequently requested and was granted leave to file an Amended Complaint incorporating additional
allegations but no new causes of action (Doc. 20, Pl.'s Unopposed Mot. for Leave to File Am. Compl.; Doc. 21, Electronic
Order Granting Mot. for Leave), which Plaintiff then filed on July 11, 2016. Confusingly, Plaintiff actually filed its Amended
Complaint twice. See Docs. 22 and 23. These documents appear to be identical, so the Court considers the later-filed
(Doc. 23) to be the operative pleading.
In another strange turn of events, Defendants never filed an updated answer in response to Plaintiff's Amended Complaint.
Nor has Plaintiff, for that matter, ever filed an answer to Defendants' counterclaims. Thus, although both sides are
technically in default, neither has raised the issue, and the parties appear to be proceeding with the understanding that
Defendants' original Answer and Counterclaims (Doc. 11)—though filed in response to Plaintiff's Original Complaint (Doc.
1)—also serves as a responsive pleading to Plaintiff's later-filed Amended Complaint (Doc. 23). Therefore, so will the
Court. See Superior Edge, Inc. v. Monsanto Co., 44 F. Supp. 3d 890, 893 n.2 (D. Minn. 2014) (citing Cartier v. Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A., 547 Fed.Appx. 800, 804 (8th Cir. 2013) (“Under these circumstances, we conclude the district court acted
within its discretion to treat the motion to dismiss the original complaint as a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.”)).
6 Plaintiff initially filed a motion for summary judgment on July 27, 2016 (Doc. 24), then asked to withdraw it the following day
(Doc. 25), which the Court allowed (Doc. 26). Plaintiff later re-filed its motion for summary judgment in November 2016.
Doc. 29. The following month, however, recognizing the Court's local rule requiring that a motion, brief, and appendix be
filed as separate documents, Plaintiff requested leave to re-file its motion in accordance with that rule (Doc. 41), which
the Court granted (Doc. 45). Plaintiff then filed the present Amended Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 46), Brief in
Support (Doc. 47), and Appendix (Doc. 48) in December 2016, the only difference from the November 2016 filing being
that the motion, brief, and appendix are now separate documents. Thus, although the Court acknowledges November 2,
2016, as the date of filing, all references in this opinion are to the Amended Motion (Doc. 46) and its attendant documents.
7 Defendants later requested (Doc. 78), and were granted (Doc. 83), leave to file several supplemental documents in
opposition to Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.
8 Although Defendants contend they had “no reasonable way of knowing there was damage to the roof without someone
getting up onto the roof with a lift or crane” (Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp. 16), Mr. Desai testified under oath that he first noticed
in November 2014—coincidentally, while “evaluating the property for potential capital improvements” (id.)—that “[w]hen
you drive up to the hotel, the shingles look really bad.” Doc. 33, Defs.' App. 18, Ex. C, Exam. Under Oath of Ajay Desai.
Defendants have not argued or provided any evidence that the damage from the June 2012 storm first manifested in
November 2014. In fact, Defendants acknowledge that “the type of roof damage at issue is not the type which becomes
more severe over time....” Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp. 21. Desai also testified that he visited the property approximately once
a week. Doc. 33, Defs.' App. 18, Ex. C., Exam. Under Oath of Ajay Desai. Presumably, then, the “bad” roofs would have
been visible to Mr. Desai every week when he drove up to the hotel between the date of the storm and November 2014.
Furthermore, as mentioned above, the damage is not only to the roofs but also to the hotel's siding. See, e.g., Doc. 33,
Defs.' App. 412, Ex. K, Phipps Computer Log Notes (noting that the “exterior EIFS has hail damage on each elevation
requiring repairs and bids from two local stucco/eifs contractors”). And though Derek Phipps noted that distinguishing
hail damage from other types of damage might require some level of expertise, he also testified that there was clearly
damage to the hotel's siding which was visible from the ground. Compare  Doc. 33, Defs.' App. 100, Ex. D, Dep. of Derek
Phipps (“Q: Do you agree that, in order to determine damage to EIFS from hail, as opposed to some other type of loss

or wear and tear, that you need some sort of experience or training? A: I think so. Q: It's not something that the average
person is going to be able to identify; would you agree with that? A: Typically, yeah.”), with Doc. 33, Defs.' App. 127–
28 (“Q: .... With your naked eye, if you're walking at ground level, at this hotel, at this property ... can you see damage
to the EIFS siding? A: You can. Q: And do you need a ladder to see that? A: No. Q: Do you need a lift to see that? A:
No. I found the damage as we were walking around it....”).
9 Defendants also point to the letters and computer log notes between Frontier Adjusters and Peninsula Insurance Bureau
mentioned above to argue that because the claim appeared to be moving along through the claims process, Underwriters
was “able to conduct a full, fair and complete investigation of Defendants' loss.” Doc. 78-1, Defs.' Mot. for Leave to File
Suppl. Record 2.
10 Because this order is dispositive of the case, Underwriters's Objections to Defendants' Expert Witness Disclosure (Doc.
58) is OVERRULED as moot  at this time. Additionally, the parties' Joint Motion for Status Conference (Doc. 90) is also
DENIED as moot.

*1  Before the Court are Defendant Barry Bays's Motion
to Exclude Testimony of Plaintiff's Expert Jordan Trecki,
Ph.D. (“Dr.Trecki”) and Motion to Exclude Plaintiff's Expert
Michael L. Van Linn, Ph.D. (“Dr. Van Linn”) (docs.177, 178),
both filed on April 1, 2014. For the reasons described in this
order, the Court DENIES these motions.
I.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
This case arises out of an alleged conspiracy to manufacture
and distribute synthetic cannabis products across the country.
On August 23, 2013, a complaint was filed against
Defendant Barry Bays alleging violations of 21 U.S.C.
§§ 841  and 846. Doc. 1, Compl. A federal grand jury
returned a one-count indictment against Defendants Barry
Bays, Samuel Madeley, and David Muise on September
17, 2013, charging the defendants with violating 21 U.S.C.
§ 846  (Conspiracy to Distribute a Controlled Substance
Analogue). Doc. 13, Indictment 1. On January 23, 2014,
Bays and five other defendants were named in a multi-count
superseding indictment charging violations of 21 U.S.C.
§ 846  (Conspiracy to Distribute a Controlled Substance
Analogue). Doc. 117, Second Sup. Indictment 1–2. The
superseding indictment also separately charged Bays with
violating 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c)(1)(A)  and (c)(2) (Possession
of a Firearm in Furtherance of a Drug Trafficking Crime)
and 21 U.S.C. § 843(b) (Using a Communication Facility to
Facilitate a Drug Felony). Id.
On April 1, 2014, Defendant Bays filed both the Motion to
Exclude Dr. Trecki (doc. 177), and the Motion to Exclude
Dr. Van Linn (doc 178). Defendant Bays argues that under
Federal Rules of Evidence 104, 702, and 703 and Daubert v.
Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct.
2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), the opinions of Dr. Van Linn
and Dr. Trecki should be excluded to the extent that they opine
on the substantial similarity of the four chemical substances
identified in the Second Superseding Indictment to schedule I
synthetic cannabinoids.1 Second Sup. Indictment 1–2; Def.'s
Mot. to Excl. Trecki 1; Def.'s Mot. to Excl. Van Linn 1.
II.
LEGAL STANDARD
Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence  provides for
the testimony at trial of an “ expert by knowledge, skill,
experience, training, or education,” if such testimony “will
assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to
determine a fact in issue.” Fed.R.Evid. 702 . Accordingly,
the Court acts as a “gatekeeper” that “may admit proffered
expert testimony only if the proponent, who bears the burden
of proof, demonstrates that (1) the expert is qualified, (2)
the evidence is relevant to the suit, and (3) the evidence
is reliable.” Nunn v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,  No.
3:08–CV–1486–D, 2010 WL 2540754, at *2 (N.D. June 22,
Tex.2010) (citing Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael,  526 U.S.
137, 152, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999)).
Whether an expert is qualified to testify is a question of law.
Mathis v. Exxon Corp.,  302 F.3d 448, 459 (5th Cir.2002)
(citing Fed.R.Evid. 104(a) ). As such, “[b]efore a district
court may allow a witness to testify as an expert, it must
be assured that the proffered witness is qualified to testify
by virtue of his knowledge, skill, experience, training, or
education.' ” Nunn, 2010 WL 2540754, at *2 (quoting United

## Page 2

States v. Cooks,  589 F.3d 173, 179 (5th Cir.2009)  (internal
quotation marks omitted). However, “ Rule 702  does not
mandate that an expert be highly qualified in order to testify
about a given issue.” Huss v. Gayden, 571 F.3d 442, 452 (5th
Cir.2009). Instead, “[d]ifferences in expertise bear chiefly on
the weight to be assigned to the testimony by the trier of
fact, not its admissibility.” Id.; see also Daubert, 509 U.S. at
596 (“Vigorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary
evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof are
the traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but
admissible evidence.”).
*2  “Evidence is relevant if ‘it has any tendency to make
any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the
action more probable or less probable than it would be without
the evidence.’ ” Wellogix, Inc. v. Accenture, L.L.P ., 716 F.3d
867, 882 (5th Cir.2013)  (quoting Fed.R.Evid. 401(a)). Said
differently, expert testimony is relevant when the expert's
“reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the
facts in issue.” Daubert, 509 U.S. at 593 . Conversely, “[e]
xpert testimony which does not relate to any issue in the case
is not relevant and, ergo, non-helpful.” Id. at 591.
Evidence is reliable if “ ‘the reasoning or methodology
underlying the testimony is scientifically valid.’ ” Knight v.
Kirby Inland Marine, Inc., 482 F.3d 347, 352 (5th Cir.2007)
(quoting Daubert, 509 U.S. at 593). To determine whether the
methodology employed by an expert is scientifically valid,
the Court considers five non-exclusive factors: “1) whether
the expert's technique or theory can be or has been tested-
that is, whether the expert's theory can be challenged in some
objective sense, or whether it is instead simply a subjective,
conclusory approach that cannot reasonably be assessed for
reliability; 2) whether the technique or theory has been subject
to peer review and publication; 3) the known or potential
rate of error of the technique or theory when applied; 4) the
existence and maintenance of standards and controls; and 5)
whether the technique or theory has been generally accepted
in the scientific community.” Florer v. Elec. Data Sys. Corp.,
No. 303CV1175H, 2004 WL 1562851, at *3 (N.D.Tex. July
13, 2004).
To be sure, the reliability test is a flexible one that grants
district courts wide discretion, and Daubert' s dictates apply
“not only to testimony based on ‘scientific’ knowledge, but
also to testimony based on ‘technical’ and ‘other specialized’
knowledge.” Kumho Tire, 526 U.S. at 141 . Reliability does
not mean certainty, but more than speculation is required.
Nunn, 2010 WL 2540754, at *2  (citing Daubert, 509 U.S.
at 590). Correspondingly, a court may consider one or more
of the Daubert factors, as well as other factors “ ‘relevant to
the case at hand,’ ” in determining the reliability of proffered
testimony Paz v. Brush Engineered Materials, Inc., 555 F.3d
383, 388 (5th Cir.2009)  (quoting Black v. Food Lion Inc.,
171 F.3d 308, 312 (5th Cir.1999)); see Kumho Tire, 526 U.S.
at 138 (“A trial judge determining the admissibility of an ...
expert's testimony may consider one or more of the specific
Daubert factors.”).

ANALYSIS
The Defendant's Motions to Exclude Expert Testimony are
considered within the context of the Controlled Substance
Analogue Enforcement Act of 1986 (“CSAEA”), which
“Congress enacted ... to keep up with rapidly progressing
drug technologies and to target the distribution of so-called
‘designer drugs.’ ” United State v. Nasir, No. 5:12–CR–102–
JMH, 2013 WL5373619, at *1 (E.D.Ky. Sept. 25, 2013)
(citing United States v. Washam,  312 F.3d 926, 933 (8th
Cir.2002)); 21 U.S.C. § 813. DEA has concluded that each of
the substances at issue-AM2201, 5F–PB–22, PB–22, and 5F–
UR–244 (a .k.a.XLR11)-is a schedule I controlled substance
or controlled substance analogue. 21 C.F.R. § 1308.11(g)-(h);
Doc. 184, Pl.'s Resp. 2. A controlled substance analogue is a
substance:
*3  (i) the chemical structure of which is substantially
similar to the chemical structure of a controlled substance
in schedule I or II;
(ii) which has a stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic
effect on the central nervous system that is substantially
similar or greater than the stimulant, depressant, or
hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system of a
controlled substance in schedule I or II; or
(iii) with respect to a particular person, which such person
represents or intends to have a stimulant, depressant,
or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system
that is substantially similar or greater than the stimulant,
depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous
system of a controlled substance in schedule I or II.
21 U.S.C. § 802(32)(A) . In short, a chemical substance
must be “substantially similar” to a controlled substance in
schedule I or II. Defendant notes that “ ‘substantially similar’

is not a scientific concept,' ” and that “the analogue act does
not indicate that the term ‘substantially similar’ is to be
defined in any scientific sense.” Def.'s Mot. to Excl. Trecki
2–3 (quoting Anacker & Imwinkelried, Controlled Substance
Analogue Enforcement Act Criminal Defense,  37 SW. U.L.
REV . 267, 295 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).
The Court agrees. Indeed, “there is no indication that
Congress intended the words ‘substantially similar’ to have
a specialized or scientific meaning.” United States v. Reece,
No. 12–00146, 2013 WL 3865067, at *9 (W.D.La. July
24, 2013) . “Therefore, these words should be given their
ordinary meanings.”  Id.; see also United States v. Brown, 279
F.Supp.2d 1238, 1240–41 (S.D.Ala.2003),aff'd 415 F.3d 1257
(11th Cir.2005) (“Since the Analogue Act does not indicate
that the term ‘substantially similar’ is to be defined as it is
used scientifically, the court will interpret those words as
they are used in everyday language.”). Under this construct,
“substantially similar” is read “as having ‘essential elements
in common.’ ” Alemeda Mall, L.P . v. Shoe Show, Inc., 649
F.3d 389, 392 (5th Cir.2011) (citing Random House Webster's
College Dictionary (2d ed.1999)) (defining “substantially
similar” in a trade-name dispute). Accordingly, Defendant
asserts that Dr. Van Linn and Dr. Trecki are unfit to testify as
to whether AM2201, PB–22, and 5F–UR–144 (a.k.a.XLR11)
have essential elements in common with JWH–018, and
whether 5F–PB–22 has essential elements in common with
AM2201. Def's Mot. to Excl. Trecki; Def.'s Mot. to Excl. Van
Linn.
A. Van Linn
1. Qualifications
Defendant first complains that Dr. Van Linn, due to his
embrace of flawed methodologies, is unqualified to offer
expert testimony. Doc. 190, Def.'s Reply 2.
The Government, in contrast, offers an extensive list of
accomplishments to showcase Dr. Van Linn's pedigree:
employment as a forensic chemist in DEA's Office of
Diversion Control (ODE), Drug and Chemical Evaluation
Section, since September 2013; previous work as a forensic
chemist with DEA's North Central Laboratory in Chicago,
Illinois, and as a research scientist at Cambridge Major
Laboratories in Germantown, Wisconsin; and numerous past
positions in academia, including a post-doctoral fellowship.
Pl.'s Resp. 4. In addition, Dr. Van Linn is the co-author almost
twenty peer-reviewed articles and has received awards for
outstanding work. Id.
*4  Defendant's contention that Dr. Van Linn's methods
somehow render him unqualified to testify as an expert
is misguided. As previously noted, an expert witness
may be qualified based upon his “knowledge, skill,
experience, training, or education.” Fed.R.Evid. 702. Absent
from the list of qualifying factors is subscription to
any certain methodology or principle, which is instead
considered by the reliability prong. Fed.R.Evid. 702(c) ;
see also Knight, 482 F.3d at 352 . While an expert's
qualifications and the reliability of his methodology may
be related, they are not dependent upon one another.
Engenium Solutions, Inc. v. Symphonic Technologies, Inc.,
924 F.Supp.2d 757, 770–71 (S.D.Tex.2013) (finding experts
qualified but subsequently excluding their testimony after
considering their methodology under the reliability prong).
Qualified experts sometimes employ unreliable methods and
unqualified experts sometimes employ reliable methods.
Here, Dr. Van Linn's methodology does not diminish his
qualification as an expert. Dr. Van Linn's advanced degree,
work history as a forensic chemist, and previous experience in
academia leave the Court little doubt that he has “specialized
knowledge [that] will help the trier of fact to understand the
evidence,” and is therefore qualified under the factors set
out by Rule 702 to testify as an expert witness. Fed.R.Evid.
702(a).
2. Relevance
Defendant next attacks the relevance of Dr. Van Linn's
testimony under Federal Rules of Evidence 702  and 402.
Def.'s Reply 2. Dr. Van Linn's opinion is irrelevant, Defendant
contends, because the Government failed to provide any
evidence of the sound chemistry required to determine
substantial similarity. Id.
In response, the Government argues that Dr. Van Linn
applied sound methods and principles to the facts of the
case while analyzing the degree of similarity between: (1)
AM2201, PB–22, and 5F–UR–144 (a.k.a.XLR11)and JWH–
018; and (2) 5F–PB–22 and AM2201. Pl .'s Resp. 4. More
specifically, Dr. Van Linn correctly relied on two-dimensional
renderings and knowledge obtained from reviewing current
scientific literature and chemistry information to compare the
structural components of each substance, the chemical class
of the substances by determining their core structure, and the
differences between each substance. Id.

a. Federal Rule of Evidence 702
As stated above, expert testimony is relevant when the
expert's “reasoning or methodology properly can be applied
to the facts in issue.” Daubert, 509 U.S. at 593 . Here, the
facts in issue turn on the question of substantial similarity.
See, e.g., United States v. Bamberg,  478 F.3d 934, 939
(8th Cir.2007); Brown, 415 F.3d at 1264; Reece, 2013 WL
3865067, at *5 n. 21 . The Fifth Circuit has explained “that
drugs which have been chemically designed to be similar to
controlled substances, but which are not themselves listed
on the controlled substances schedules, will nonetheless
be considered as schedule I substances” if they meet the
substantial similarity requirements set forth in § 802(32)
(A). United States v. Granberry,  916 F.2d 1008, 1010 (5th
Cir.1990). There is some question, however, as to what those
requirements are.
*5  As the old adage instructs, the devil is in the details-
the relevant detail here being the single word “or” between
clauses (ii) and (iii) of the definition. There are two possible
readings of the definition. Under a disjunctive reading,
a substance that satisfies any one  of the[ ] three criteria
qualifies as a controlled substance analogue. Under a
conjunctive reading, the provision requires two things: (1)
[t]he substance in question must have a chemical structure
substantially similar to a controlled substance (criterion
one) and (2) it must either have a substantially similar [or
greater] effect on the central nervous system (criterion two)
or be purported or intended to have such an effect (criterion
three).
United States v. Turcotte, 405 F.3d 515, 521 (7th Cir.2005) .
Defendant correctly notes that a majority of courts interpret
the elements of § 802(32)(A)  conjunctively, as opposed to
disjunctively .2 Def.'s Mot. to Excl. Van Linn 2 n. 3; see also
Reece, 2013 WL 3865067, at *7 n. 31.3 The manner in which
the Government presents its experts suggests that it, too,
endorses a conjunctive interpretation. See Pl.'s Resp. 3–7. The
Fifth Circuit also seems to favor a conjunctive reading and,
although it “has not yet expressly weighed on which method
of interpretation should be employed ..., [it has] paraphrased
the definition in a way that is consistent with a conjunctive
interpretation ... [and can be read] as implicitly adopting a
conjunctive reading of the statute.” Reece, 2013 WL 3865067,
at *7 (citing Granberry, 916 F.2d at 1010).
While the Court tends to agree that a conjunctive reading
is preferable, such determination is unnecessary to reach a
decision on relevancy. Here, it is quite clear that Dr. Van
Linn's reasoning and methodology can properly be applied
to the facts in issue. Satisfaction of the chemical structure
criterion of § 802(32)(A) is sufficient for substantial similarity
under a disjunctive reading and necessary for substantial
similarity under a conjunctive reading. See Turcotte, 405 F.3d
at 521 . In other words, an expert's opinion on chemistry
directly relates to an integral issue on the case: whether the
chemical structure of the compounds identified in the Second
and Third Superseding Indictments is substantially similar
to that of schedule I synthetic cannabinoids. Accordingly,
Dr. Van Linn, a chemist, is anticipated to offer testimony
that will “assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence
or to determine a fact in issue.” Daubert, 509 U.S. at 589;
Pl.'s Resp. 3–5. The Court therefore concludes that the expert
opinion of Dr. Van Linn is relevant under the standards set
forth by Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and Daubert.
b. Federal Rule of Evidence 402
Defendant also asserts that the testimony of Dr. Van Linn
should be excluded as irrelevant pursuant to Federal Rule of
Evidence Rule 402. Def.'s Reply 2.
Rule 402 functions as a liberal, baseline standard of relevance
for all testimony, not just that of experts, and is less rigorous
than Rule 702 and Daubert. 509 U.S. at 587. Under Rule 402,
relevant evidence “is admissible unless otherwise provided
by federal statutory or constitutional law, the Federal Rules
of Evidence, or ‘other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court
pursuant to statutory authority.’ ” United States v. Perez–Solis,
709 F.3d 453, 464 (5th Cir.2013)  (citing Fed.R.Evid. 402).
This standard grants district courts “broad discretion in ruling
on questions of relevancy.” United States v. Waldrip, 981 F.2d
799, 806 (5th Cir.1993). “The burden is on the party opposed
to admission of evidence to show a reason for its exclusion.”
United States v. D.K.G. Appaloosas, Inc., 630 F.Supp. 1540,
1562 (E.D.Tex.1986).
*6  As previously discussed, the expert opinion of Dr. Van
Linn is relevant under the standard set forth in Rule 702 .
Testimony that is relevant under the high bar set by Rule
702's expert standard is also relevant under the lower bar set
by Rule 402 's baseline standard. See Bocanegra v. Vicmar
Servs., Inc., 320 F.3d 581, 584 (5th Cir.2003)  (“The expert
testimony must be relevant, not simply in the sense that
all testimony must be relevant [under] Fed.R.Evid. 402, but
also in the sense that the expert's proposed opinion would
assist the trier of fact to understand or determine a fact in
issue.”). Further, Defendant failed to identify any authority
that might preclude Dr. Van Linn from offering testimony.

## Page 5

U.S. v. Bays, Not Reported in F.Supp.3d (2014)

More precisely, Defendant cited to no authority whatsoever.
Instead, Defendant offered only conclusory allegations of
irrelevancy in support of his argument for exclusion. Def.'s
Reply 2. The Court therefore determines that Defendant failed
to satisfy his burden, and consequently concludes that Dr. Van
Linn's testimony is relevant under Rule 402.
3. Reliability
Defendant next turns to the reliability of Dr. Van Linn's
expected testimony, which is as follows:
1. In comparing the chemical structures for 5F–PB–22 and
AM2201, the difference in chemical structures is minor and
insignificant given that it consists of only a single atom
substitution and an addition of a single atom. Therefore,
5F–PB–22 is substantially similar in chemical structure to
AM2201, a schedule I controlled substance.4
2. In comparing the chemical structures for AM2201 and
JWH–018, the difference in chemical structure is minor and
insignificant given that it consists of only a single atom
substitution. Therefore, AM2201 is substantially similar in
chemical structure to JWH–018, a schedule I controlled
substance.
3. In comparing the chemical structures for PB–22 and
JWH–018, the difference in chemical structure is minor
and insignificant given that it consists only of a single
atom substitution and an addition of a single atom.
Therefore, PB–22 is substantially similar in chemical
structure to JWH–018, a schedule I controlled substance.
4. In comparing the chemical structures for 5F–UR–
144 (a.k.a.XLR11) and JWH–018, the difference in
chemical structure is minor and insignificant given that
it consists only of a change in the peripheral ring system
and a single atom substitution. Therefore, 5F–UR–
144 (a.k.a.XLR11) is substantially similar in chemical
structure to JWH–018, a schedule I controlled substance.
Def.'s Mot. to Excl. Van Linn, Exs. 1–4.
a. Idiosyncratic Comparison Under An Unscientific
Standard
Defendant first contends that Dr. Van Linn's testimony,
purportedly based on a review of current scientific literature
and chemistry information, constitutes mere idiosyncratic
comparison instead of scientific opinion. Def.'s Mot.
to Excl. Van Linn 5–6. Dr. Van Linn's opinion is
unreliably inconsistent, Defendant says, because he finds
different chemicals substantially similar for different reasons.
Defendant goes on to posit that, even if Dr. Van Linn's
opinion were consistent, it would still be nothing more than an
idiosyncratic comparison of two chemicals because there is
no scientific method to determine analogues. Def.'s Reply 6.
*7  In response, the Government argues that courts have
accepted DEA, and specifically ODE, opinions on analogues
and their underlying methodology for decades. Further,
Defendant's reasoning is flawed because he attacks Dr. Van
Linn's conclusions, whereas the Court's sole focus should be
an expert's principles and methodologies. Pl.'s Resp. 11, 13.
The Court finds Defendant's argument that there is
no acceptable method to determine substantial similarity
wanting, and agrees with the Government that DEA opinions
and methodology are widely accepted by courts. See United
States v. Makkar, No. 13–CR–0205–CVE, 2014 WL 1385298,
at *3 (N.D.Okla. Apr.9, 2014)  (noting that the DEA
“comparison of chemical substances are not novel scientific
issues” and denying defendant's request to exclude Dr. Van
Linn's expert testimony on substantial similarity between
JWH–018 and XLR11). If there were no scientific or expert
method to determine analogues, then expert testimony would
be a moot point for both sides. Reality shows otherwise. See
Doc. 108, Def.'s Mot. to Appoint Expert.
Defendant's attack on Dr. Van Linn's methodology by
virtue of his conclusions and their underlying rationale is
similarly unpersuasive. Defendant maintains that Dr. Van
Linn's methods are unreliable because a majority of scientists
believe that UR–144 (a.k.a.XLR11) is not substantially
similar in chemical structure to JWH–018, and that the
addition of an atom precludes between two chemicals from
being substantially similar. Def.'s Mot. to Excl. Van Linn 6–7;
see also The Smoke Shop, LLC v. United States, 949 F.Supp.2d
877, 879 (E.D.Wisc.2013)  “[T]he overwhelming weight of
opinion in the scientific community is that the chemical
structure of UR–144 and XLR–11 are not substantially similar
to the chemical structure of JWH–018 ....”). Defendant is
correct that, in some cases, an expert's conclusions can
affect the reliability of his testimony. See General Elec. Co.
v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 146, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d
508 (1997)  (explaining that methodology and conclusions
are not entirely divorced, and that courts may exclude
expert testimony where there is “too great an analytical gap
between the data and the opinion proffered.”); Fed.R.Evid.
702 advisory committee's note (“[W]hen an expert purports to
apply principles and methods in accordance with professional

standards, and yet reaches a conclusion that other experts in
the field would not reach, the trial court may fairly suspect that
the principles and methods have not been faithfully applied.”)
(citing Lust v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,  89 F.3d
594, 598 (9th Cir.1996). Defendant's position that this is one
of those cases, however, is unfounded.
First, the authority Defendant relies upon, The Smoke Shop,
has been criticized by numerous courts. See, e.g., United
States v. Riley,  No. 2:12–CR–00478–JAD–UCF, 2014 WL
537013, at *5–6 (D.Nev. Feb.7, 2014)  (explaining that the
court was reluctant to give merit to any scientific opinions
expressed in The Smoke Shop  due to a lack of reasoning
for its conclusion); United States v. Carlson,  No. 12–CR–
305 (DSD/LIB), 2013 WL 5125434, at *30 n. 33 (D.Minn.
Sept.12, 2013) (“The Court [in The Smoke Shop  ] made no
holding that UR–144 and XLR11 are not controlled substance
analogues as a matter of law.”). Second, there is no one
avenue that an expert must take to determine whether two
chemical compounds are substantially similar. See United
States v. Ansaldi, 372 F.3d 118, 123–24 (2d Cir.2004) (finding
substantial similarity when there was a three atom difference);
Roberts, 363 F.3d at 124–27 (finding substantial similarity
when there was a two atom difference and the substance
turned into the controlled substance when ingested); Pl.'s
Resp., Ex. A Reinhold Depo. at 41:14–16 (“[O]ne atom
switched out is the most specific definition of an analogue
that I can find ....”). Finally, while trial courts may have
cause to suspect expect testimony that arrives at an outlying
conclusion, such conclusions are by no means automatically
unreliable. See Fed.R.Evid. 702 advisory committee's note;
see also Riley, 2014 WL 537013, at *5.
*8  After considering the standards accepted by other courts,
it is hardly an analytical leap to find, in this context, that
two chemical compounds are substantially similar based on
the addition of one atom. As such, the Court concludes that
Dr. Van Linn's conclusions are not per se unreasonable so as
to render his opinion unreliable. If Defendant has evidence
establishing that such changes substantially alter the chemical
structure of the compounds in question, that evidence can
be presented at trial to discredit Van Linn's conclusions. See
United States v. 14.38 Acres of Land, More or Less Situated
in Leflore County, 80 F.3d 1074, 1077 (5th Cir.1996).
b. Two–Dimensional Modeling
Defendant next attacks Dr. Van Linn's use of two-dimensional
modeling to establish the substantial similarity of two
chemical compounds. Def.'s Reply 3–4. This method is
unreliable, Defendant says, due to statements made by
Lindsey Reinhold in an evidentiary exhibit submitted by
the Government. In particular, Ms. Reinhold stated that “it
is important to look at both two dimensional and three
dimensional structures” in comparing chemical structure, and
that every finding of substantial similarity is a matter of each
chemist's opinion. Pl.'s Resp., Ex. A Reinhold Depo. at 34:12–
23.
In reply, the Government asserts that two-dimensional
structures are the primary manner in which chemists
communicate, as reflected in many peer-related journals,
and have been expressly approved by both the scientific
community and courts. Pl.'s Resp. 11. Further, Ms. Reinhold
agreed that, based on DEA's use of two-dimensional
structures, she would concur that AM2201 was substantially
similar to JWH–018.5 Id., Ex. A Reinhold Depo. at 41:5–19.
Here, too, the Court agrees with the Government that two-
dimensional modeling is a reliable method of comparing
the chemical structure of two compounds. Ms. Reinhold
stated in her deposition that, when comparing two chemical
compounds, two-dimensional models were useful for
determining core structure and three-dimensional models
were useful in identifying attached functional groups to see
how they are similar. Pl.'s Resp., Ex. A Reinhold Depo. at
34:18–23. Ms. Reinhold continued to say that, based on these
considerations, she felt comfortable identifying AM2201 as
an analogue of JWH–018 “with the understanding that there
are chemists out there that my disagree with [her].” Id. at
41:17–19.
Defendant misapprehends Ms. Reinhold's statement that
other experts may disagree with her opinion to mean that
two-dimensional modeling is an unreliable method. Def.'s
Reply 3–4. As previously discussed, substantial similarity
is not a scientific question and there is no requirement that
experts agree on its exact definition. See Carlson, 2013
WL 5125434, at *26  (“[Defendant's] argument regarding a
lack of consensus of a definition of ‘substantially similar’
in the chemistry community overlooks the fact ... that the
question of whether a substance is substantially similar to
another substance is not a scientific question and looks
beyond the mere physical properties of a substance.”); United
States v. Fedida, 942 F.Supp.2d 1270, 1279 (M.D.Fla.2013)
(“[T]he Government need not overcome the critical eye of
chemists and other experts ... [r] ather, it must merely show
that ordinary people would be able to determine whether
[the substances in question] are proscribed analogues of [a

## Page 7

U.S. v. Bays, Not Reported in F.Supp.3d (2014)
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 7
schedule I or II controlled substance].”). While Ms. Reinhold
may determine that a three-dimensional model is appropriate,
other experts, like Dr. Van Linn, may decide to rely solely on
a two-dimensional model. In any event, determining which
approach is best is not this Court's charge. See Ruize–Troche v.
Pepsi–Cola of P .R., 161 F.3d 77, 85 (1st Cir.1998) (“Daubert
neither requires nor empowers trial courts to determine
which of several competing scientific theories has the best
provenance.”).
*9  Accordingly, the Court concludes that two-dimensional
modeling is not an inherently unreliable method of comparing
the chemical structure of two compounds. See Brown, 415
F.3d at 1267  (affirming trial court's admission of expert
testimony on chemical structure in controlled substance
analogue case based solely on visual assessment of a two-
dimensional model even though it “only met one of the four
Daubert factors.”); Moore v. Ashland Chem. ., Inc., 151 F.3d
269, 276 (5th Cir.1998)  (“The proponent need not prove to
the judge that the expert's testimony is correct, but [he] must
prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the testimony
is reliable.”).
c. Lack Of Peer Review and Reliance on Unpublished
Studies
Finally, Defendant criticizes Dr. Van Linn's failure to cite
to peer-reviewed studies and questions his reliance on
unpublished studies, arguing that they give no insight into
how he formed his conclusions or analyzed the chemicals
to determine if they were substantially similar. Def.'s Mot.
to Excl. Van Linn 6.; Def.'s Reply. 2. Defendant goes on to
erroneously argue that the Fifth Circuit has altogether rejected
the notion that expert opinions can be based on unpublished
studies.6 In response, the Government states that, due to
the changing nature of the “designer” drug marker, often
times there is little or no peer-reviewed literature specific to
particular substances, and contends that publication is not an
essential requirement of admissibility or reliability. Pl.'s Resp.
9.
Again, the Court agrees with the Government that Defendant's
concerns regarding Dr. Van Linn's use of unpublished
scientific studies go to the weight of the evidence rather than
the admissibility of his opinions. Viterbo v. Dow Chem. Co.,
826 F.2d 420, 422 (5th Cir.1987). Peerreview, while helpful,
is not itself determinative of reliability. See Roman v. W.
Mfg., Inc., 691 F.3d 686, 694 (5th Cir.2012)  (“The absence
of textual support or published studies is not dispositive
when reliable methods are used.”); Knight, 482 F.3d at
354–55 (explaining that there is no bright-line standard
requiring publication or peer review, and that a lack of textual
support goes to the weight of an expert's testimony, not
its admissibility). Similarly, “[p]ublication (which is but one
element of peer review) is not a sine qua non of admissibility;
it does not necessarily correlate with reliability, and in some
instances well-grounded but innovative theories will not have
been published.” Daubert, 509 U.S. at 593 (internal citations
omitted). Given the rapid developments and fluctuating
landscape of the “designer” drug market, the Court concludes
that Dr. Van Linn's use of unpublished scientific studies when
evaluating the chemical structure of the substances in this case
does not make his opinion intrinsically unreliable. As such,
the exclusion of the whole of Dr. Van Linn's testimony is
inappropriate at this time.
B. Trecki
1. Qualifications
*10  Defendant next attacks the admissibility of the
Government's pharmacological expert, Dr. Trecki. Defendant
argues that Dr. Trecki is unqualified to render expert
testimony due to his embrace of flawed methodologies. Def.'s
Reply 2.
In response, the Government contends that Dr. Trecki,
a pharmacologist in DEA's ODE, Drug and Chemical
Evaluation Section since 2012, regularly monitors, evaluates,
and recommends emerging drugs for scheduling under the
Controlled Substances Act, and lends his scientific opinion
regarding drugs of abuse to local, state, and federal agencies.
Pl.'s Resp. 5. Additionally, Dr. Trecki has previous work
experience as neuropharmacologist and neurotoxicologist
at the Environmental Protection Agency, has served as
an adjunct professor and held a post-doctoral fellowship,
coauthored peer-reviewed articles, and given presentations to
scientific societies. Id. at 5–6.
The Government also states that Dr. Trecki has already been
qualified as an expert and provided similar testimony in
other federal courts.7 Id. Defendant counters by arguing that
he lacks access to Dr. Trecki's previously admitted testimony.
Def.'s Reply 5–6.
As previously discussed, “an expert witness may be qualified
based upon his “knowledge, skill, experience, training, or
education,” but not by his embrace of a certain method
or principle. See Fed.R.Evid. 702(a) ; Knight, 482 F.3d at

 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 8
352; Engenium Solutions,  924 F.Supp.2d at 770–71 . Here,
even if the court were to disregard Dr. Trecki's previous
testimony, he would still qualify as an expert based on his
current and previous work experience, history in academia,
and expertise in scheduling under the Controlled Substance
Act. See McNamara v. Bre–X Minerals, Ltd., No. 5:97–CV–
159, 2002 WL 32076175, at *4 (E.D.Tex. Sept.30, 2002)
(finding the witness's education and experience qualified him
as an expert even though he lacked trial experience in the area
of testimony.) As such, the Court concludes that, under the
factors set out by Rule 702, Dr. Trecki is qualified to testify
as an expert witness. See Fed.R.Evid. 702(a).
2. Relevance
Defendant next challenges the relevance of Dr. Trecki's
opinion under Federal Rules of Evidence 402  and 702,
alleging that the Government failed to show the sound
pharmacology necessary to determine substantial similarity.
Def.'s Reply 2. In response, the Government argues that Dr.
Trecki applied sound methods and principles to the facts of
the case while analyzing: (1) the degree of similarity between
AM2201, PB–22, and 5F–UR–144 (a.k.a.XLR11) and JWH–
018; and (2) 5F–PB–22 and AM2201. Pl.'s Resp. 6. More
specifically, Dr. Trecki correctly relied on data from in vitro
receptor binding and functional studies, data from in vivo
studies in animals, and scientific literature from National
Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) studies. Id.
As discussed above, expert testimony is relevant when the
expert's “reasoning or methodology properly can be applied
to the facts in issue.” See Daubert, 509 U.S. at 593 . The
facts currently in issue turn on the question of substantial
similarity. See Reece, 2013 WL 3865067, at *5 n. 21 . Here,
as with the testimony of Dr. Van Linn, there is little question
that Dr. Trecki's reasoning and methodology apply directly
to the issue at hand. See supra p. 9. Satisfaction of one
of the two pharmacological criterion of § 802(32)(A)  is
sufficient for substantial similarity under a disjunctive reading
and necessary for substantial similarity under a conjunctive
reading. Id.; see also Turcotte, 405 F.3d at 521. Accordingly,
Dr. Trecki, a pharmacologist, is anticipated to offer testimony
that will “assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence
or to determine a fact in issue.” Daubert, 509 U.S. at 589;
Pl.'s Resp. 5–7. The Court therefore determines that the expert
opinion of Dr. Trecki is relevant under the standards set forth
by Rule 702 and Daubert. As the high bar is met, so too is the
low. Correspondingly, the Court finds Dr. Trecki's testimony
relevant under Rule 402 based on the logic set forth above.
See Bocanegra, 320 F.3d at 584.
3. Reliability
*11  Defendant next turns to the reliability of Dr. Trecki's
expected testimony, which is as follows:
1. AM2201 has a cannabinoid-like pharmacological effect
on the central nervous system that is substantially similar to
the cannabinoid-like pharmacological effects on the central
nervous system as JWH–018, a schedule I controlled
substance.
2. 5F–PB–22 has a cannabinoid-like pharmacological
effect on the central nervous system that is substantially
similar to the cannabinoid-like pharmacological effects
on the central nervous system as AM2201, a schedule I
controlled substance.
3. PB–22 has a cannabinoid-like pharmacological effect on
the central nervous system that is substantially similar to
the cannabinoid-like pharmacological effects on the central
nervous system as JWH–018, a schedule I controlled
substance.
4. XLR11 has a cannabinoid-like pharmacological effect
on the central nervous system that is substantially similar to
the cannabinoid-like pharmacological effects on the central
nervous system as JWH–018, a schedule I controlled
substance.
Def.'s Mot. to Excl. Trecki, Exs. 1–4.
a. Lack Of Peer Review and Reliance on Unpublished
Studies
Defendant first complains that Dr. Trecki's opinion is
unreliable because it is based, in part, on studies that are not
publically available, have not been provided to the defense,
cannot be tested or empirically verified by the scientific
community, and are not admissible under Federal Rule of
Evidence 703. Def.'s Mot. to Excl. Trecki 5; Def.'s Reply 2–
3. In particular, Defendant alleges that Dr. Trecki improperly
relied on confidential NIDA reports.
The Government, meanwhile, contends that there is no legal
requirement for an expert to cite only to published articles
in formulating opinions, and points out that NIDA, a leader
in the field of drug research for decades, relies upon well-
founded scientific principles and methodologies. Pl.'s Resp.
12. Further, Dr. Trecki's opinion is based on studies conducted
by qualified individuals in the scientific community whose

## Page 9

U.S. v. Bays, Not Reported in F.Supp.3d (2014)
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 9
work has been internally peer-reviewed but has yet to be
published publically. Id. at 10.
The Court agrees with the Government that this matter
is appropriately dealt with by crossexamination than by
exclusion. See 14.38 Acres of Land, 80 F.3d at 1077.
For starters, Defendant's assertion that the Government
incorrectly relied upon confidential NIDA research is
mistaken.8 Def.'s Mot. to Excl. Trecki 5. First, Defendant
fails to provide the Court appropriate criteria with which
to review his argument. A Request for Proposal (“RFP”) is
a requisite step to entering into a NIDA research contract.
Because each NIDA contract is unique, different RFPs have
different confidentiality requirements and statements of work.
See NIDA Requests for Contract Proposals (RFPs), National
Institute on Drug Abuse, http://www.drugabuse.gov/fun ding/
funding-opportunities/nida-requests-contract -proposals-rfps
(revised July 2014) (listing active RFPs with different
confidentiality levels and requirements). Accordingly, it is
incorrect to assume that the dictates of one flow uniformly to
another. Here, the Court lacks an applicable standard because,
even though Defendant based his argument on an RFP's
confidentiality requirements, Dr. Trecki never used that RFP
or its subsequent research contract in forming any of his
submitted opinions. See Def.'s Mot. to Excl. Trecki, Exs. 1–5.
*12  Second, even if the confidentiality requirements in
Defendant's proffered RFP were universal, Defendant fails to
show that the research in question would be confidential or
that he would otherwise be unable to access to it. Indeed, the
main purpose of the confidentiality requirement is to protect
private sources' proprietary information. Pl.'s Mot. to Excl.
Trecki, Ex. 5 at 4. Consequently, “it is likely that NIDA will
approve publication by the Contractor of data generated on ...
non-proprietary compounds.” Id. As there is no indication that
Dr. Trecki relied upon proprietary information, Defendant
should be able to gain access to any research which Dr. Trecki
used in forming his opinions because “if the Government
allows use of the data for any purpose other than direct
contract performance, it will be made available for release to
any interested party.” Id. at 18.
Third, other courts have permitted experts to offer opinions
based, in part, on NIDA research when testifying as to
the substantial similarity of a chemical compound to a
controlled substance. See Makkar, 2014 WL 1385298, at *3
(allowing DEA expert witness on pharmacology to review
studies conducted by NIDA on synthetic cannabinoids during
controlled substance analogue proceeding). As such, the
Court determines that Dr. Trecki's reliance on unpublished
NIDA research is permissible and does not render his expert
opinion unreliable.
In addition, Defendant offers nothing more than a conclusory
statement to support his contention that Dr. Trecki's methods
cannot be tested or empirically verified by the scientific
community. Def.'s Mot. to Excl. Trecki 5. The Court's focus
is on an expert's methods and principles, not the conclusions
they generate. See Joiner, 522 U.S. at 146. While the studies
referenced by Dr. Trecki may be unpublished, the Court
agrees that the methodologies that he and NIDA employed
are well known and can be cross-checked and examined
by Defendant. See Daubert, 509 U.S. 593 (explaining that
publication is not a not a sine qua non  of admissibility or
reliability); Knight, 482 F.3d at 354 (internal quotation marks
omitted) (“Where an expert other reliably utilizes scientific
method to reach a conclusion, lack of textual support may
go to the weight, not the admissibility of the expert's
testimony.”).
Finally, Defendant has not sufficiently undermined the
reliability of Dr. Trecki's reliance on unpublished studies so
as to preclude admission of his opinion under Federal Rule
of Evidence 703. Experts may rely on otherwise inadmissible
facts or data “[i]f experts in the particular field would
reasonably rely on those kinds of facts or data in forming an
opinion on the subject.” Fed.R.Evid. 703. The Court finds that
the Government has sufficiently demonstrated that experts
would rely on unpublished NIDA research or internally peer-
reviewed given the quickly evolving and fluid nature of
drug analogue cases. Pl.'s Resp. 9–10, 13–14. Therefore,
the Court concludes that Dr. Trecki's opinion is admissible
under Rule 703. See Brown, 415 F.3d at 1268  (“This means
that expert testimony that does not meet all or most of the
Daubert factors may sometimes be admissible.”); Makkar,
2014 WL 1385298, at *3 . If Defendant wishes to test or
otherwise challenge Dr. Trecki's testimony or the underlying
bases for his opinion, he may do so at trial with forceful
crossexamination and the presentation of contrary evidence.
Viterbo, 826 F.2d at 422 (“As a general rule, questions relating
to the bases and sources of an expert's opinion affect the
weight to be assigned that opinion rather than its admissibility
and should be left for the jury's consideration.”).
b. Studies Conducted Specifically In Anticipation of
Litigation

## Page 10

U.S. v. Bays, Not Reported in F.Supp.3d (2014)
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 10
*13  Defendant next complains that the studies Dr. Trecki
relied upon were not conducted as part of his normal research,
but specifically in anticipation of litigation. Def.'s Mot. to
Excl. Trecki 6. Defendant points to the studies' short time-
frame to support his position. Id. In response, the Government
contends that Dr. Trecki did carry out the studies as part of
his occupational duties, and that the cramped time-frame is
due to dynamic landscape of the “designer” drug market. Pl.'s
Resp. 11.
Once more, the Court agrees with the Government.
See Simpson v. Quarterman,  593 F.Supp.2d 922, 937
(E.D.Tex.2009) (“Finders of fact are cautioned to consider
the possible bias of an expert witness ‘including any bias
you may infer from evidence that the expert witness has
been or will be paid for reviewing the case and testifying, or
from evidence that he testifies regularly as an expert witness
and his income from such testimony represents a significant
portion of his income.”) (quoting Fifth Circuit Pattern
Jury Instructions–Civil Cases, Pattern Instruction 2.19, pg.
23 (2006); Daubert, 43 F.3d 1311, 1317 (9th Cir.1995)
(explaining that court should consider “whether the experts
are proposing to testify about matters growing naturally and
directly out of research they have conducted independent of
the litigation, or whether they have developed their opinions
expressly for purposes of testifying.”). Although the time-
frame in which Dr. Trecki carried out his research is brief,
conducting studies on evolving drugs of abuse, is, by its
nature, a fluid undertaking with unexpected developments
and uncertain schedules. Pl.'s Resp. 5. Moreover, while
testifying as an expert witness is not an infrequent occurrence
for Dr. Trecki, he does so as a DEA agent, not a career expert
witness searching for additional income. Consequently, the
Court concludes that the time-line of Dr. Trecki's research is
not indicative of his preparing expressly for the purpose of
testifying, and does not weaken the reliability of his opinion.
c. Use Of In Vivo and In Vitro Studies
Finally, Defendant attacks Dr. Trecki's reliance on in vivo and
in vitro studies. Def.'s Mot. to Excl. Trecki 7. These methods
are unreliable, Defendant says, because they view the results
of drug research carried out on animals as representative of
those drugs' effects on humans. Defendant also contends that
the Fifth Circuit has rejected in vitro  and in vivo  studies
to establish causation in humans. Id. at 8; see also Allen
v. Pennsylvania En'g Corp.,  102 F.3d 194 (5th Cir.1996) .9
Defendant goes on to note that evidentiary rulings in criminal
cases are subject heightened scrutiny. Def.'s Reply 7.
In response, the Government again argues that the special
circumstances surrounding controlled substance analogues
necessitate a different standard than the usual scientific
methodology used for testing drugs. Pl.'s Resp. 12; see
also United States v. Klecker,  228 F.Supp.2d 720, 729
(E.D.Va.2002) ( “[T]he use of the term substantially similar
in the Analogue Act creates an entirely different test than
the scientific methodology required in the prescription drug
approval process.”).
*14  The Court recognizes that “evidentiary rulings are
subjected to heightened scrutiny in criminal cases.” United
States v. John,  597 F.3d 263, 274 (5th Cir.2010) . This,
however, does not change the fact that “the rejection of expert
testimony is the exception rather than the rule.” Fed.R.Evid.
702 advisory committee's note. Moreover, while the Fifth
Circuit cautions that “ ‘studies of the effects of chemicals
on animals must be carefully qualified in order to have
explanatory potential for human beings,’ ” it does not hold
them universally invalid as matter of law. Johnson v. Arkema,
685 F.3d 452, 463 (5th Cir.2012) (quoting Allen, 102 F.3d at
197).
The Court concludes that the research and study of controlled
substance analogues is unique and satisfies the careful
qualification requirement for animal studies. Additionally, the
Court is disinclined to exclude testimony that other courts
frequently admit in controlled substance analogue cases. See,
e.g., Nasir, 2013 WL 5373619, at *3  (rejecting defendant's
motion to exclude expert testimony on pharmacological
effect of synthetic cannabinoids based on rodent drug
discrimination tests in controlled substance analogue case);
United States v. McFadden,  No. 3:12CR00009, 2013 WL
8339005, at *5 (W.D.Va. May 10, 2013)  (stating that
expert testimony based on animal studies was properly
admitted in a controlled substance analogue case and that
any “shortcomings identified by the defendant went to the
weight it should be given rather than its admissibility”),
aff'd, 753 F.3d 432 (4th Cir.) . As such, the Court concludes
that Dr. Trecki's reliance on in vivo  and in vitro  studies
was not so fundamentally unreasonable as to render his
opinion unreliable. If Defendant has contrary evidence that
casts doubt on the accuracy of Dr. Trecki's conclusions,
that evidence can be presented at trial. Mathis, 302 F.3d at
461. Accordingly, the exclusion of the whole of Dr. Trecki's
testimony at this time is unwarranted.

IV .
CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, Defendant's Motion to
Exclude Testimony of Plaintiff's Expert Jordan Trecki,
Ph.D., and Motion to Exclude Plaintiff's Expert Michael
L. Van Linn, Ph.D. (Docs.177, 178), are DENIED. Should
it become evident during the trial of this matter that the
testimony of either Dr. Van Linn or Dr. Trecki will not assist
the trier of fact, Defendant may re-urge his objections to such
testimony.

Footnotes
1 On May 20, 2014, a federal grand jury re-alleged the charges in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841 and 846 and, in addition,
charged Bays and three other defendants with violating 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1349 (Conspiracy to Commit Mail Fraud).
Doc. 222, Third Sup. Indictment 3. The conspiracy to commit mail fraud charge, issued after the Defendant filed this
motion, identifies additional chemical substances not mentioned in the previous indictments. Those charges, however,
are not at issue in the instant motion. The pertinent charges in the Third Superseding Indictment arising under 21 U.S.C.
§§ 841 and 846 identify the same four chemical substances as the Second Superseding Indictment: AM2201, 5FPB–22,
PB–22, and 5F–UR–144 (a.k.a.XLR11). Second Sup. Indictment 1–2; Third Sup. Indictment 4 at ¶ 12.
2 A conjunctive reading of 21 U.S.C. § 802(32)(A) was adopted in the following cases: Brown, 415 F.3d at 1261; Turcotte,
405 F.3d at 523; United States v. Roberts, 363 F.3d 118, 121 (2d Cir.2004); United States v. Hodge, 321 F.3d 429, 433
(3d Cir.2003); Washam,  312 F.3d at 930; see Reece, 2013 WL 3865067, at *7 n. 31.
3 The Court notes that Defendant's footnote bears striking resemblance to the Reece court's footnote on the same topic.
Curiously, there is no corresponding citation.
4 The Court notes that Defendant erroneously states that Dr. Van Linn found “the [difference between the] chemical
structures for AM2201 and JWH–018 ... is minor and insignificant given that it consists of only a single atom substitution
and an addition of a single atom,” instead of relaying his actual finding that 5F–PB–22 was substantially similar to AM2201.
Def.'s Mot. to Excl. Van Linn 4–5.
5 The Court notes Defendant's contention that Ms. Reinhold did not find AM2201 and JWH018 were substantially similar,
but instead chemical analogues. Def.'s Reply 4. The Court also dismisses this stance as superfluous; two chemicals
cannot be chemical analogues-under either the Federal definition or Pennsylvania state statute that controlled Ms.
Reinhold's research during the occasion in question-without being substantially similar. See Pl.'s Resp, Ex. A Reinhold
Depo. at 41:17–19; 45:10–13.
6 Defendant relies on Moore, 151 F.3d at 278, which, in pertinent part, states, “[i]n the absence of an established scientific
connection between exposure and illness, or compelling circumstance such as those discussed in Cavallo, the temporal
connection between exposure to chemicals and an onset of symptoms, standing alone, is entitled to little weight in
determining causation.” The Fifth Circuit, in this case, was dealing with a toxic tort claim where the expert in question
failed to produce any scientific support for his conclusion. Indeed, the phrase “unpublished scientific study” does not
appear throughout the entirety of the opinion.
7 The Court notes that the Government lists Carlson, 12–cr–305; Reece, 6:12–cr–146; and The Smoke Shop, LLC, 2:12–
cv–1186 as cases that Dr. Trecki has previously testified in, and provides their case numbers to Defendant so he might
be able to search for available docket sheets.
8 Defendant paraphrases the requirement that “[n]one of these data may be used at any time for any purpose except to
generate reports or other requirements specified in the Statement of Work, without prior written approval of the NIDA
Contracting Officer.” Def.'s Mot. to Excl. Trecki, Ex. 5 at 18, Art. H.8 (emphasis added); see 48 C.F.R. 352.224–70 (2010)
(outlining confidentiality and privacy requirements applicable to NIDA RFP). Notably, the corresponding Statement of

Work goes on to say that “the resulting data are used by the DEA to support scheduling recommendations for new drugs
of abuse.” Id. at
9 Defendant cites to other authority that it is neither applicable to the matter at hand nor binding on this Court. See
Wade–Greaux v. Whitehall Labs., Inc., 874 F.Supp. 1441, 1453 (D.Vi.1994) aff'd, 46 F.3d 1120 (3d Cir.1994) (rejecting
extrapolation by experts of animal experiments to determinations of human birth defects); Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. v. Havner, 953 S.W.2d 706, 729 (1997) (stating that animal studies cannot act as stand alone conclusive evidence
that a substance has a given biological effect on humans.).

MEMORANDUM ORDER
JANE J. BOYLE, District Judge.
*1  Super Future Equities, Inc. (“SFE”) filed this action
against Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, N.A. (“Wells Fargo”);
ORIX Capital Markets, LLC (“Orix” or “Orix Capital”);
ORIX USA Corporation (“Orix USA”); John Dinan; Michael
F. Wurst; Clifford Weiner; James R. Thompson; and ORIX
Capital Markets Partnership (“Orix Partnership”) 1, claiming
breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, gross negligence, breach
of contract, and civil violations of Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”). 2 Presently before the
Court is Defendant Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.'s Motion for
Summary Judgment (doc. 314); Orix Defendants' Motion
for Summary Judgment (doc. 318); Defendant Wells Fargo's
Motion to Strike Certain of Plaintiff's Summary Judgment
Evidence (doc. 438); and Orix Defendants' Objections and
Motions to Strike Plaintiff's Evidence in Support of Its
Response to the Orix Defendants' Motion for Summary
Judgment (doc. 448). For the reasons that follow, the
Court GRANTS the Defendants' motions to strike Plaintiff's
evidence to the extent that they request the exclusion of
the portion of Thomas Arjmandi's declaration attempting to
value the certificates; the motions to strike other evidence are
DENIED as Moot. The Court also GRANTS the Defendants'
motions for summary judgment on all of SFE's claims.
I. Background
This case involves the world of Commercial Mortgage
Backed Securities (“CMBS”) transactions. In a traditional
mortgage loan situation, the loans are serviced by the
mortgage banker loan correspondents that originated the
loans. Deborah O. McKinnon et al, Standard Roles and
Responsibilities of the Master and SubServicers in CMBS
Transactions (Mortgage Bankers Association May, 2000).
However, CMBS transactions differ in that servicing is
provided by servicers who were not the originators of the
loans. Id. Disputes about these servicing activities have
spawned the controversy in this case.
In a CMBS transaction, a loan is funded and then sold
to a special purpose, bankruptcy-remote entity, which the
Court will refer to as a “trust.” (Orix Defs.' Br. in Supp.
of their Mot. for Summ. J. (“Orix's Br.”) 4). These trusts
purchase a number of loans to form a large, diversified
pool of loans. ( Id.). The purchase of these loans is funded
by the proceeds from the issuance of certificates that are
purchased by investors (known as “the certificate holders”).
(Id.). A Pooling and Servicing Agreement (“PSA”) sets out
the procedures for administering the loans, establishes the
priority for allocating the cash flow generated by the loans
among the certificate holders, and divides the responsibility
for trust matters among: (1) the Master Servicer, (2) the
Special Servicer, and (3) the Trustee. ( Id.; Wells Fargo's Br.
in Supp. of its Mot. For Summ. J. (“Wells Fargo's Br.”) 6).

The Master Servicer's  duties include collecting the loan
payments and passing the funds to the Trustee, enforcing loan
documents for untroubled loans, advancing late payments
to the Trustee, and providing performance reports to the
certificate holders. Baxter Dunaway, 4L Law of Distressed
Real Estate  § 56.14 (2007); Wells Fargo's Br. 6; Pl.'s Br.
in Resp. to Orix's Mot. for Summ. J. (“Pl.'s Resp. to Orix's
MSJ”) 1. The Master Servicer may transfer loans that are
not being paid or do not comply with the loan documents
to the Special Servicer who will work out the problems or
foreclose on the loan. (Wells Fargo's Br. 6). This Special
Servicer is selected by the holder of the lowest class of
certificates, also known as the “Controlling Class.” ( Id.).
The Trustee's duties include holding the mortgage collateral,
distributing funds collected by the Master Servicer to the
certificate holders, supervising the Master Servicer and
Special Servicer, ensuring that the servicers comply with the
PSA, and appointing new servicers if the PSA is violated.
Baxter Dunaway, 4L Law of Distressed Real Estate  § 56.14
(2007).
*2  The trust issues different classes or “tranches” of
certificates with each class having a different level of risk.
Under the PSA's, senior grade or Class A certificate holders
take on the lowest amount of risk because they receive
payments of principal and interest before the other classes, but
they are sold at a higher price and receive less interest on their
investment. (Orix's Br. 4; Wells Fargo's Br. 8; Pl.'s Second
Am. Compl. (“SAC”) ¶ 18). Lower classes of certificate
holders or B-Piece or first loss certificate holders bear more
risk because they receive payments from borrowers only after
all other certificate holders are paid but also have a higher
expected yield. (Orix's Br. 4; Wells Fargo's Br. 8, SAC ¶ 18).
Under this system, the Servicers collect monthly principal and
interest payments from the borrowers on the loans in the trust.
(Wells Fargo's Br. 8). From these payments, the Servicers
withhold expenses for servicer fees, litigation expenses, and
advance reimbursements and then transfer the rest to the
Trustee. (Id.). The Trustee will first distribute interest to Class
A certificate holders and, if there is money remaining, will
then distribute interest to Class A-2 certificate holders. ( Id.).
If funds still remain, the Trustee will distribute to Class B
certificate holders and so on. ( Id.). If the money runs out,
lower classes of certificate holders do not receive interest
payments that month. (Id.). The Trustee distributes principal
in a similar manner, but the more senior grade certificate
holder must be paid all of its principal before the certificate
holder at the lower level receives any principal. (Id .).
This lawsuit arises out of the relationship between a
certificate holder and the Servicer, Special Servicer, and
Trustee of two CMBS trusts: (1) the Trust for the
Certificate holders of the Merrill Lynch Mortgage Investors,
Inc. Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 1999-C1
(“MLMI Trust”) and (2) the Trust for the Certificate
holders of the First Union-Lehman Brothers-Bank of America
Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificate Series 1998-
C2 (“FULBBA Trust”) (collectively “the Trusts”). SFE
purchased Class B Certificates in the MLMI Trust on April
7, 2005 and Class A-2 Certificates in the FULBBA Trust on
July 28, 2005 (SAC ¶¶ 77, 139).3 After purchasing the master
servicing rights (in October 1998) and special servicing rights
(in June 2000) in the FULBBA Trust, Orix Capital became
the Master and Special Servicer of the Trust as well as a
holder of first loss certificates. (Orix's Br. 6). When the MLMI
Trust was established in November 1999, Orix Capital was
named the Master and Special Servicer and also held first loss
certificates in the Trust. (Id.). The individual Defendants are
all officers, directors, or employees of Orix Capital. (SAC ¶
31). Orix USA is allegedly interrelated with Orix Capital and
the individual Defendants. (SAC ¶¶ 31, 38). Wells Fargo is
the Trustee for both of the Trusts. (Pl.'s Response to Orix's
MSJ 1).
*3  SFE accuses the Orix Defendants of numerous misdeeds
stemming from these servicing relationships, including:
• “Manufactur[ing] defaults of performing loans in order to
charge unnecessary servicing fees and advances to the
Trusts;
• Pursu[ing] unnecessary litigation against borrowers and
guarantors of loans in a manner that depletes the Trusts'
assets and benefits only ORIX at the expense of the
certificate-holders;
• Bring[ing] disingenuous, unnecessary, and non-beneficial
litigation-funded out of the Trusts-against the entities
that deposited the loans into the Trusts in order
to generate fees paid by litigation advances and
reimbursements from the Trusts and wrongfully
retain[ing] the proceeds of settlement of such litigation;
• Mak[ing] inaccurate reports to the Trustee and certificate-
holders, including false reporting and allocation of its
fees and litigation expenses, in an effort to hide its
wrongful activities from SFE and other certificate-
holders; and

• Operat[ing] the Trusts to inflate the value of the inferior
‘lower tranch’ certificates held by it and extend[ing]
their life, in order to sell the certificates at a huge profit,
while leaving the Trusts in such poor condition that other
certificate-holders will certainly suffer huge losses in
their investments.”
(Pl.'s Resp. to Orix's MSJ 2).
With respect to Wells Fargo, SFE alleges the following
conduct:
• “Execut[ing] ill-advised powers of attorney authorizing
Orix to act as Wells Fargo's agent and attorney-in-fact in
connection with the Trusts;
• Look[ing] the other way-in violation of fiduciary duties
owed to SFE-as ORIX violated duties owed to the Trusts
and the certificate-holders;
• Obtain[ing] financial benefits at the expense of the
certificate-holders of both Trusts while failing to fulfill
its duties; and
• Knowingly distribut[ing] false and fraudulent data to the
certificate-holders regarding the Trusts.”
(Pl.'s Br. in Resp. to Wells Fargo's Mot. for Summ. J. (“Pl.'s
Resp. to Wells Fargo's MSJ”) 1-2).
Based on these allegations, on February 13, 2006, SFE filed
its Original Complaint-Class Action (doc. 1) claiming breach
of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, and RICO violations
against Wells Fargo, Orix Capital, Orix Partnership, Orix
USA, and the individual Defendants. On April 10, 2006,
SFE filed its First Amended Complaint-Class Action (doc.
5), adding claims of negligence and gross negligence. After
Defendants filed two separate motions to dismiss, SFE was
granted leave to file an amended complaint and filed its
Second Amended Complaint-Class Action on June 26, 2006.
The Court struck SFE's class allegations on August 28, 2006
for failure to timely file a motion for class certification and
ordered SFE to file an amended complaint removing its class
allegations. SFE thereafter filed its fourth complaint, styled
Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint, which is the live
complaint, on September 11, 2006.
*4  On August 3, 2007, Wells Fargo filed the instant
motion for summary judgment (doc. 314) arguing that: (1)
SFE lacks Article III standing to bring this suit because it
has no damages; (2) SFE has no evidence of racketeering
activity by Wells Fargo; (3) SFE cannot establish a breach
of fiduciary duty by Wells Fargo; (4) SFE has no evidence
to support a negligence or gross negligence claim against
Wells Fargo; and (5) the PSA's relieve Wells Fargo of liability
for SFE's claims. (Wells Fargo's Br. In Supp. of its Mot.
for Summ. J. (“Wells Fargo's Br.”)). The Orix Defendants
also moved for summary judgment (doc. 318) based on
the following: (1) SFE cannot show demonstrable damage;
(2) SFE lacks standing to assert claims on behalf of the
trusts making summary judgment appropriate on all of its
inherently derivative claims; (3) the individual Defendants
cannot be liable for alleged breaches of the PSA's; (4) there
is no evidence that the individual Defendants committed any
tortious acts; (5) there is no evidence that Orix USA is liable
for any of SFE's claims including breach of the PSA's or the
alleged torts; (6) SFE's claims against the Orix Defendants
are barred by the “no-action clause” in the PSA's; (7) SFE is
bound by the waivers and disclaimers of liability in the PSA's;
(8) summary judgment is appropriate on SFE's RICO claims
under both the “No-Evidence” motion for summary judgment
and traditional motion for summary judgment standards; (9)
any claim for negligence or gross negligence is impermissibly
duplicative of the alleged contract claim; and (10) any claim
for breach of fiduciary duty is impermissibly duplicative of
the alleged contract claim. (Orix's Br.). SFE responded to
these motions for summary judgment on August 23, 2007
(docs.388, 390). On September 7, 2007, Wells Fargo filed
its Motion to Strike Certain of Plaintiff's Summary Judgment
Evidence (doc. 438), and Orix filed Objections and Motion
to Strike Plaintiff's Evidence in Support of Its Response to
the Orix Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (doc.
448). Wells Fargo and Orix filed their summary judgment
replies on September 7, 2007 (docs.450, 454). Both motions
for summary judgment, being fully briefed, are now ripe for
adjudication. Despite all of these allegations and arguments,
these motions for summary judgment boil down to: (1) the
admissibility of the evidence SFE submitted in response to
the motions for summary judgment, (2) the choice of law
for SFE's causes of actions; (3) whether SFE has presented
sufficient evidence of injury and causation to establish Article
III standing; and (4) whether SFE has presented sufficient
evidence of damages to support each of its causes of action.
II. Orix and Wells Fargo's Motions to Strike Thomas
Arjmandi's Declaration
As a prelude to reviewing the motions for summary judgment,
the Court will address the Defendants' arguments that
SFE's summary judgment evidence is inadmissible. When

determining the admissibility of evidence on a motion
for summary judgment, courts generally apply the same
standards and rules that govern the admissibility of evidence
at trial. Donaghey v. Ocean Drilling & Exploration Co.,
974 F.2d 646, 650 n. 3 (5th Cir.1992)  (citing Lavespere
v. Niagara Machine & Tool Works, Inc.,  910 F.2d 167,
175-76 (5th Cir.1990), abrogated on other grounds by Little
v. Liquid Air Corp., 37 F.3d 1069, 1076 n. 14 (5th Cir.1994)).
Orix contends that the declaration of Thomas Arjmandi
(“Arjmandi”), SFE's corporate representative and president,
is inadmissible because it contradicts his former deposition
testimony that he could not quantify SFE's damages. 4 (Orix
Reply Br. 4). Orix also claims that Arjmandi's Declaration
is an “eleventh hour ambush” and that he is not qualified
to testify as an expert (Orix's Mot. to Strike 25-26 (citing
KW Plastics v. U.S. Can Co.,  131 F.Supp.2d 1289, 1295
(M.D.Ala.2001)). Similarly, Wells Fargo claims, in its
motion to strike SFE's summary judgment evidence, that
Arjmandi's declaration contains inadmissible hearsay and
improper lay opinions and contradicts SFE's designated 30(b)
(6) deposition testimony. (Wells Fargo's Mot. to Strike 4).
A. SFE's Evidence
*5  The Court will first examine SFE's evidence and then
analyze whether the evidence SFE submitted in response
to the motions for summary judgment is admissible. In its
initial disclosures, SFE stated that it “has not yet made
an exact calculation of any damages owing to it by the
Defendants.” (Wells Fargo App. 115, Orix App. 472). SFE
listed nine categories of damages, placing monetary amounts
on three of them. 5 In its First Supplemental Rule 26
Disclosures, SFE claimed its damages were the purchase price
of the certificates of $165,000 or their diminishment in value
of no less than $24,700. (Orix App. 478; Wells Fargo App.
1432). It also listed quantities for gains and fees earned by
the Defendants.6 In its interrogatory responses, SFE claimed
that the certificates were worthless and that SFE lost at
least $164,700. (Orix App. 485). SFE objected to subsequent
interrogatories requesting injuries for its causes of actions
stating that the interrogatories were vague, ambiguous,
overbroad, duplicative, requested a legal conclusion, and
attempted to limit damages. (Orix App. 489-92). SFE referred
to its responses to disclosures and expert testimony and
stated that the Defendants have not provided information
on this subject. (Orix App. 489-92). SFE stated that it is
entitled to recover the purchase price of the certificates or their
diminishment in value and the gains made by the Defendants.
(Orix App. 489-92). When requested to detail the amount and
method of calculating damages, SFE made similar objections
and stated that it was entitled to the purchase price of the
certificates of $165,000 or the lost market value of no less
than $24,700. (Orix App. 492-93).
In his July 12, 2007 deposition, less than a month before
the Defendants filed their motions for summary judgment,
Arjmandi stated that he was not aware of any lapse in payment
of interest on the certificates and had not calculated any
damages resulting from lack of interest payments. (Orix App.
502-503). The following exchange also occurred:
Q. Has SFE been damaged because of its holdings in the
MLMI and FULBBA certificates? A. I believe so, yes. Q.
Can you quantify that damage? A. Numerically? Q. Yes.
A. No, not as I sit here right now.... Q. No. Do you plan
on testifying at the trial of this case as to the value of the
certificates. A. I don't know what the particular plans are
at trial. Q. Do you have any reason to believe that you are
qualified to opine as to the value of the certificates SFE
holds in the MLMI and FULBBA trusts? A. Well, I do
know that an expert has been retained, I believe, whose
testimony will be on the damages to the certificates by
the underlying activities of the servicer and the trustee. Q.
That is Victor Moore? A. Correct. Q. So you believe Victor
Moore will testify or attempt to value SFE's certificates,
is that your understanding? A. And the damages therein, I
believe so.
(Orix.App.502-04). On July 30, 2007, Victor Moore testified
that he had no opinion on damages and whether the
Defendants' actions caused damages to SFE, that he was not
asked to look at damages, and that he could not quantify the
value of the certificates. (Orix App. 512-514, 517). SFE's
expert Eli Clark stated that he believed SFE suffered financial
harm stating that:
*6  to the degree that they have received interest payments
on time but those interest payments have come at a cost, I
think that would harm their interest in the long-term. And
then you have ... a separate question as to whether or not-
the underlying bonds and earned certificates have also been
diminished in value.
(Orix App. 526). Clark stated that he would not testify
regarding the value of SFE's certificates and that this was
outside of his legal expertise. (Orix App 526-27).
On August 23, 2007, in its response to Wells Fargo's motion
for summary judgment, SFE submitted a declaration of
Thomas Arjmandi, also dated August 23, 2007, reciting the
purchase price of the certificates and stating that the Charles

## Page 5

Schwab account statements he obtained from the online
account reflect a decline of $25,464. (SFE App. 1570-75). In
his declaration, Arjmandi also stated,
Further, based on my familiarity with these investments
and my review of their performance, coupled with the
knowledge that I have gained regarding the manner in
which the MLMI and FULBBA Trusts have been managed
by the ORIX Defendants and Wells Fargo, it is my
assessment that these certificates have been significantly
diminished below the stated market price-if not rendered
valueless-because I cannot now in good faith sell the
certificates to a new buyer in light of the knowledge I
have regarding past and present actions of Defendants.
Specifically, I would have to fully disclose the Defendants'
violations of duties owed to SFE and other certificate-
holders which threaten the investments and will likely
result in losses to future holders.
(SFE App. 1572). In addition, SFE cites authority for the
proposition that an owner of property or a business may
testify regarding damages to the property. (Pl.'s Resp. to Wells
Fargo's MSJ 9-11).
B. Analysis
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(1)(C)  requires
disclosure of “a computation of any category of damages
claimed by the disclosing party ...” Rule 37(c)(1) provides that
a party who “without substantial justification” fails to disclose
information required by Rule 26(a) “is not, unless such failure
is harmless, permitted to use as evidence at a trial, at a hearing,
or on a motion any witness or information not so disclosed ...”
Interpreting these rules, Design Strategies,  held that the
plaintiff had “not provided sufficient discovery regarding the
amount of or basis for calculating damages based on alleged
lost profits” and could not provide evidence of lost profits
at trial. Design Strategies, Inc. v. Davis, 367 F.Supp.2d 630,
633, 636 (S.D.N.Y .2005). The plaintiff's disclosed financial
statements did not provide a method for calculating the profits
that it would have earned if it had been awarded the contract.
Id. at 635. The court reasoned:
While the financial statements may indicate Design's
standard profit margin, they do not provide any basis on
which to calculate the specific sum of money that the
Contentville Project would have generated had it been
awarded to Design, nor the percent of that sum that Design
would retain.
*7  Id. In Szusterman, the Court excluded evidence
of damages because the plaintiff had not furnished the
methodology for calculating damages and had stated in his
deposition that he did not know how he calculated the figure.
Szusterman v. Amoco Oil Co.,  112 Fed. Appx. 130, 131-32
(3rd Cir.2004). Similarly, in KW Plastics, the Court excluded
the expert's unjust enrichment calculations as violations of
Rule 26(a)(2)(B) because he did not seek to quantify this type
of damages in his earlier reports or pleadings:
To allow McGowan to testify as to unjust enrichment, when
he has never shown any prior inclination for doing so,
would reward U.S. Can for its misdeeds and countenance
an end-run around the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and
the orders of the court. Such litigation tactics, which are
neither justified nor harmless, cannot stand.
131 F.Supp.2d at 1295-96.
While KW Plastics, Design Strategies,  and Szusterman
involved exclusion of evidence at trial, Rule 37(c)(1) has been
applied to exclude an expert affidavit filed in response to a
motion for summary judgment because it was untimely. Trost
v. Trek Bicycle Corp.,  162 F.3d 1004, 1006 (8th Cir.1998) ;
see also Brainard v. Am. Skandia Life Assurance Corp., 432
F.3d 655, 664 (6th Cir.2005)  (excluding an expert affidavit
submitted in response to a motion for summary judgment
because it was substantially different from the expert report).
In Trost, the Court reasoned that the defendant had prepared
its motion for summary judgment, in part, based on the lack
of expert evidence to support the plaintiff's claims and that
the defendant would be prejudiced because of lack of time
to refute the evidence at trial. Id. at 1008-09. Finally in
Omaha Public, the Court excluded an affidavit in response
to a motion for summary judgment because the opinion had
not been previously disclosed, the plaintiff did not present
an explanation for the lateness, the defendant would be
prejudiced because trial was less than three months away,
and the defendant had moved for summary judgment because
there was no expert testimony. Omaha Pub. Power Dist.
v. Siemens Aktiengesellschaft,  2002 WL 826830, at *3-*5
(D.Neb.2002).
In this case, Rule 37(c)(1) should preclude this Court
from considering Arjmandi's affidavit. Like the plaintiffs in
Szusterman and KW Plastics,  Arjmandi did not purport to
quantify SFE's damages in his deposition and indicated that
he could not do so. Furthermore, as in Design Strategies, SFE
has not provided a method for calculating the value of the
certificates. This failure to comply with the Rule 26(a)(1)(C)
requirement of the disclosure of computations of damages
should result in exclusion of the evidence unless the party
has substantial justification or the failure was harmless. Fed.

R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1) . SFE has not offered any justification, 7
and the Court finds that the Defendants would be harmed
by the evidence because, like the defendants in Trost and
Omaha Public, they relied on the lack of damages evidence in
preparing their motions for summary judgment. Accordingly,
the Court excludes Arjmandi's affidavit and will not consider
it for purposes of this motion for summary judgment.
*8  In addition to Rules 26(a)(1)(C) and 37(c)(1), Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure  30(b)(6) also supports exclusion of
Arjmandi's affidavit. Rule 30(b)(6) provides:
A party may in the party's notice and in a subpoena
name as the deponent a public or private corporation or
a partnership or association or governmental agency and
describe with reasonable particularity the matters on which
examination is requested. In that event, the organization so
named shall designate one or more officers, directors, or
managing agents, or other persons who consent to testify on
its behalf, and may set forth, for each person designated, the
matters on which the person will testify ... The persons so
designated shall testify as to matters known or reasonably
available to the organization ...
Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6). Federal courts have interpreted this
rule as prohibiting a 30(b)(6) representative from disclaiming
the corporation's knowledge of a subject at the deposition
and later introducing evidence on that subject. See Ierardi v.
Lorillard, Inc., 1991 WL 158911, at *3 (E.D.Pa.1991).
For example, in Rainey, the defendant's 30(b)(6) corporate
representative stated that he did not know whether he
knew what percentage of the plaintiff's time was spent on
exempt functions. Rainey v. Am. Forest & Paper Ass'n,
Inc., 26 F.Supp.2d 82, 92 (D.D.C.1998) . In response to
the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, the defendant
filed an affidavit of a former employee quantifying the
plaintiff's work. Id. at 93-94. The Court excluded this affidavit
reasoning that Rule 30(b)(6) required the defendant to prepare
its designee to give binding answers. Id. at 94. Unless it can
prove that the information was not known or was inaccessible,
a corporation cannot later proffer new or different allegations
that could have been made at the time of the 30(b)(6)
deposition. Id. (citing Ierardi, 1991 WL 158911, at *3).
Rule 30(b)(6) “aims to prevent a corporate defendant from
thwarting inquiries during discovery, then staging an ambush
during a later phase of the case.” Id. at 95; see also United
States v. J.M. Taylor, 166 F.R.D. 356, 362 (M.D.N.C.1996)
(“[I]f a party states it has no knowledge or position as to
a set of alleged facts or area of inquiry at a Rule 30(b)(6)
deposition, it cannot argue for a contrary position at trial
without introducing evidence explaining the reasons for the
change”); Ierardi, 1991 WL 158911, at *3 (“Under Rule 30(b)
(6), defendant has an obligation to prepare its designee to
be able to give binding answers on behalf of H & V . If the
designee testifies that H & V does not know the answer to
plaintiffs' questions, H & V will not be allowed effectively to
change its answer by introducing evidence during trial. The
very purpose of discovery is ‘to avoid ‘trial by ambush.’ ' ”)
(quoting Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Butcher, 116 F.R.D. 196,
201 (E.D.Tenn.1986)).
In his July 12, 2007 deposition, Arjmandi stated that as
he sat there he could not quantify the plaintiff's damages.
When asked if he was qualified as an expert to testify, he
responded that he believed SFE would have an expert to
testify. In response to the Defendants' motions for summary
judgment, Arjmandi filed a declaration purporting to quantify
the damages. Because Arjmandi previously testified that
he could not quantify the damages and has not offered an
explanation for his change in position, his affidavit should be
excluded under Rule 30(b)(6). Accordingly, Orix and Wells
Fargo's motions to strike the portion of Arjmandi's declaration
placing a value on the certificates are GRANTED. Having
determined that Arjmandi's declaration should be excluded,
the Court now turns to the motions for summary judgment.8
III. Wells Fargo and Orix's Motions for Summary
Judgment
A. Summary Judgment Legal Standard
*9  Under Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings and
record evidence show that no genuine issue of material fact
exists and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter
of law. Little v. Liquid Air Corp.,  37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th
Cir.1994). “[T]he substantive law will identify which facts
are material.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242,
248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) . Only disputes
about material facts will preclude the granting of summary
judgment. Id .
The burden is on the summary judgment movant to prove that
no genuine issue of material fact exists. Latimer v. SmithKline
& French Lab.,  919 F.2d 301, 303 (5th Cir.1990) . If the
non-movant bears the burden of proof at trial, the summary
judgment movant need not support its motion with evidence
negating the non-movant's case. Rather, the movant may

## Page 7

Super Future Equities, Inc. v. Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, N.A., Not Reported in...
69 Fed.R.Serv.3d 986, RICO Bus.Disp.Guide 11,429
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 7
satisfy its burden by pointing to the absence of evidence to
support the non-movant's case. Id.; Little, 37 F.3d at 1075.
Once the movant has met its burden, the non-movant must
show that summary judgment is not appropriate. Little, 37
F.3d at 1075 (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317,
325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) ). “This burden
is not satisfied with ‘some metaphysical doubt as to material
facts,’ ... by ‘conclusory allegations,’ ... by ‘unsubstantiated
assertions,’ or by only a ‘scintilla’ of evidence.” Id. (quoting
Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp.,  475 U.S.
574, 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986) ). The
non-moving party must “come forward with ‘specific facts
showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.’ ” Matsushita,
475 U.S. at 587 (emphasis in original) (quoting Fed. R. Civ.
P. 56(e)). To determine whether a genuine issue exists for
trial, the court must view all of the evidence in the light
most favorable to the non-movant, and the evidence must be
sufficient such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict
for the non-movant. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248; Munoz v. Orr,
200 F.3d 291, 302 (5th Cir.2000).
B. Choice of Law
Before turning to the merits of the motions for summary
judgment, the Court must decide whether Texas or New York
law governs SFE's state law causes of action. In deciding the
appropriate law to apply to the party's state-based claims, the
Court applies the choice-of-law rules of the forum state, here
being Texas. Mayo v. Hartford Life Ins. Co.,  354 F.3d 400,
403 (5th Cir.2004). Absent a valid choice-of-law agreement,
Texas courts apply the “most significant relationship” test of
the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws. Id. The parties
agree that federal law governs SFE's RICO claims and New
York law governs the breach of contract claims and defenses
in this case. The contract claims are based on the PSA's which
contain a choice-of-law provision providing:
This Agreement and the Certificates shall be construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York
applicable to agreements made and to be performed in said
State, and the obligations, rights and remedies of the parties
hereunder shall be determined in accordance with such
laws without regard to conflicts of law principles.
*10  (Orix's Supplemental Br. In Supp. of Their Mot. to
Dismiss 5). Under Texas law, if the parties have agreed to
an enforceable choice of law clause, the court will apply the
law of that state to contract claims. Resolution Trust Corp. v.
Northpark Joint Venture, 958 F.2d 1313, 1318 (5th Cir.1992).
Accordingly, the Court agrees with the parties that New York
law governs the breach of contract claims and federal law
governs the RICO claims.
The parties, however, disagree about whether Texas or New
York law governs the tort claims. Wells Fargo argues that
the PSA's' choice of law provision demonstrates that New
York law “has a significant relationship to the Trusts and
the obligations created as a result of them.”  (Wells Fargo's
Br. 26 n. 16). SFE's claims involve the trusts, and the trusts
are centered in New York. ( Id.). New York is where the
depositor for the MLMI Trust is located, where two-thirds of
the mortgage loan sellers are located, and where the financing
occurred. (Id.). As for the FULBBA Trust, the depositor is
based in New York, and the mortgage loan sellers are either
registered in New York or a state other than Texas. ( Id.).
Also, the financing for that trust occurred in New York. (Id.).
Wells Fargo is not a Texas formed entity and its principal
place of business is not Texas. (Id.). Wells Fargo also argues
that SFE's location in Texas is not controlling. ( Id. (citing
Jackson v. W. Telemarketing Corp. Outbound, 245 F.3d 518,
523 (5th Cir.2001)). Orix has argued that the negligence and
gross negligence claims “will be governed by the choice-of-
law provision because they depend upon an ‘interpretation
and enforcement’ of the PSAs.” 9 (Orix Supplemental Br. In
Supp. of Their Mot. to Dismiss 6). Orix points out that the
underlying duty in SFE's negligence and gross negligence
claims is that Orix failed to meet the servicing standard in
the Trusts and the servicing standard is defined in the PSA's.
(Id. at 6-7). Orix also claims that the breach of fiduciary duty
claim relies on interpretation of the PSA's. (Id. at 7).
On the other hand, SFE argues that it and Orix have their
primary places of business in Texas. (Pl.'s Resp. to Wells
Fargo's MSJ 6 n. 2). Wells Fargo is neither a Texas nor
New York resident but “does significant business in Texas
and knew or should have known that the servicing activities
it had a fiduciary duty to monitor would be performed in
Texas.” (Id.). All of the servicing activities “were performed
(or at least controlled) in Texas.” (Id.). Finally, SFE contends
that it purchased its certificates and suffered its injuries in
Texas. (Id.).
The Court will consider the following factors when applying
choice of law principles to tort cases: “(a) the place where
the injury occurred, (b) the place where the conduct causing
the injury occurred, (c) the domicil[e], residence, nationality,
place of incorporation and place of business of the parties, and
(d) the place where the relationship, if any, between the parties
is centered.” Hughes Wood Prods., Inc. v. Wagner, 18 S.W.3d

202, 205 (Tex.2000) (citing Restatement (Second) of Conflict
of Laws § 145(2) (1971) ; Gutierrez v. Collins, 583 S.W.2d
312, 318-19 (Tex.1979)). “Although the number of contacts
is relevant, the qualitative nature of the contacts controls.”
Jackson, 245 F.3d at 523.
*11  Considering these factors, the first factor weighs in
favor of the application of Texas law because SFE's alleged
injury occurred in Texas. SFE's breach of fiduciary duty,
negligence, and gross negligence claims are based on Orix's
servicing activities and Wells Fargo's “looking the other way”
from those activities. (SAC ¶¶ 199-205, 220-26). Therefore,
as for the second factor, the conduct causing the injury
occurred at or was controlled from Orix's place of business
in Texas. The third factor also favors Texas law because SFE
and Orix have their primary places of business in Texas and
are incorporated outside of Texas and New York while Wells
Fargo has its principle place of business in South Dakota, not
New York. (Id. at ¶ 5). Finally, the fourth factor, where the
relationship is centered, may weigh in favor of New York law
because the parties are related based on the New York Trusts.
However, in light of the other factors, the Court concludes that
the tort claims have a more significant relationship to Texas
than New York. Accordingly, the Court will apply Texas law
to the negligence, gross negligence, and breach of fiduciary
duty claims.
C. Wells Fargo's Motion for Summary Judgment-
Standing
Both Wells Fargo and Orix base their motions for summary
judgment on SFE's lack of evidence of injury or damages.
Wells Fargo argues that SFE lacks Article III standing because
it failed to establish injury-in-fact. Orix argues that SFE has
failed to provide evidence of damages, which is an essential
element of each of its causes of action. These arguments are
related in that they are based on the same lack of evidence;
however, they each require a different legal analysis. The
Court will first address Wells Fargo's standing argument
and then turn to Orix's lack of damages argument as an
alternative basis for granting summary judgment. Either of
these arguments alone would provide adequate grounds for
granting summary judgment on all of SFE's claims.
1. Article III Standing Requirements
Wells Fargo contends that SFE has no evidence that is has
suffered an injury-in fact or that any of its alleged injuries
were a result of the conduct of Wells Fargo; therefore, this
Court does not have jurisdiction over SFE's claims. (Wells
Fargo's Br. 14). The Court will consider SFE's standing as it
relates to its claims against both Wells Fargo and the Orix
Defendants. It is of no moment that Orix did not raise a
standing argument because the court may raise the issue of
Article III standing sua sponte. Ford v. NYLCare Health Plans
of Gulf Coast, Inc.,  301 F.3d 329, 331-32 (5th Cir.2002)
(raising Article III standing on appeal when the parties never
raised it and the district court did not consider it). In this case,
SFE had the opportunity to address the issue of standing in its
response to Wells Fargo's motion for summary judgment.
In order to have standing in federal court under Article III,
a plaintiff must establish the following elements: (1)injury-
in fact which is “concrete and particularized” and “actual
or imminent not conjectural or hypothetical;” (2)“a causal
connection between the injury and the conduct complained
of;” and (3)likelihood, as opposed to mere speculation, “that
the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.” Id.
at 332.  “The party invoking federal jurisdiction' bears the
burden” of proving these elements, and failure to establish
one of them will deprive the federal court of jurisdiction.
Id. (citations omitted). “At the summary judgment stage,
‘the plaintiff can no longer rest on ... mere allegations, but
must set forth by affidavit or other evidence specific facts'
validating his right to standing.” Id. at 332-33 (quoting Lujan
v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130,
119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992).
*12  The Fifth Circuit has held that a plaintiff does
not establish standing when it cannot establish injury or
causation. In Riviera, the plaintiff claimed that she bought
and used a drug, that the drug manufacturer did not provide
enough warnings, that the drug was defective, that other
people were injured by the drug, and that she had a claim
for the money she used to purchase the drug. Riviera v.
Wyeth-Ayerst Labs., 283 F.3d 315, 319 (5th Cir.2002) . The
plaintiff claimed that the loss of cash was an economic injury
and offered suggestions for how the court could calculate
damages. Id. at 319. The Court stated that “[M]erely asking
for money does not establish an injury in fact” and held that
the plaintiff did not demonstrate injury or causation. Id. at
319, 321.
In another Fifth Circuit case, the Court held that a plaintiff
who failed to provide evidence of causation lacked standing.
Ford, 301 F.3d at 333. In Ford, an orthopedic surgeon claimed
that the defendant HMO's had falsely advertised that “their
management techniques improve health care quality and that
they allow patients and doctors to make their own treatment

## Page 9

69 Fed.R.Serv.3d 986, RICO Bus.Disp.Guide 11,429
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 9
decisions.” Id. at 331. The surgeon claimed that the HMO's'
activities undercut quality and rationed medical care against
the will of doctors, that the cost control policies reduced
his income, and that the HMO's' advertising further reduced
doctors' income because it attracted new customers which
increased the HMO's' market power over the price of medical
services. Id. The plaintiff claimed that his injury was the
reduction of his income “caused by the defendants' restrictive
cost-containment policies, which allegedly have the effect
of reducing payments to contract specialists.” Id. at 333.
The Court held that the plaintiff failed to meet the causation
requirement because he was required to present evidence
affirmatively proving that his reduced income resulted from
the defendants' conduct. Id. There was “no evidence in the
record to show that Ford's income has in fact declined any
more than would be expected as a result of events completely
unrelated to the HMO's' activities.” Id. The plaintiff could
not identify a patient he had lost as a result of the conduct
and presented no evidence that he received lower payments
for his services than he would have in the absence of the
advertisements. Id. The Court explained:
[S]ome or all of the decrease in Ford's income might have
been a result of the fact that “he is not employed full time
as a physician ... and spends a significant amount of time
filming a fishing show for a sports network.” Ford bears
the burden of proving otherwise, and he has not met it.
Id.
The Seventh Circuit has addressed a situation analogous to the
case at hand. In Slowiak, a meat distributor sued corporations
claiming that they coerced him into joining a “maximum
resale price maintenance conspiracy in violation of Wisconsin
antitrust law.” Slowiak v. Land O'Lakes, Inc., 987 F.2d 1293,
1294-95 (7th Cir.1993). He claimed that the defendants would
have taken action against him if he had charged prices higher
than those on the circulated list and that he lost profits that
he would have earned if he had been able to set his own
prices. Id. at 1295.  The Court held that the plaintiff did not
have Article III standing because he presented no evidence of
injury as a result of the conspiracy. Id. at 1296. The plaintiff
conceded that his business had been profitable and at his
deposition stated that he was not sure whether he had lost
profits because of the conspiracy. Id. After the defendants
moved for summary judgment for lack of evidence of injury,
the plaintiff filed a supplemental affidavit stating that if the
prices had not been fixed “ ‘there would have been many
occasions on which I would have charged more for many of
the Schweigert products I sold.’ ” Id. The Court found that
the affidavit conflicted with his former deposition testimony
stating that he did not know if he would have been able to
sell the same amount of products at a higher price, that he
could not remember a specific instance of when he wanted
to charge more, and that he did not know how much he
could have raised prices. Id. at 1296-97. The Court held
that the deposition testimony did not establish a distinct and
palpable injury and that he could not cure this defect with a
supplemental self-serving affidavit conflicting with his earlier
deposition testimony. Id. at 1297. The Court also held that
even if the plaintiff lost money, there was no evidence that the
loss was fairly traceable to the defendants' conduct; therefore,
he lacked standing. Id. Having examined the standard and
relevant case law, the Court moves to the question of whether
SFE has established that it has been injured by the actions of
the Defendants.
2. Standing Based on the Value of the Certificates
*13  SFE responded to Wells Fargo's motion for summary
judgment with two claims of damages: (1) the purchase price
of its certificates or their diminution in value and (2) the
disgorgement of the gains made by the Defendants. 10 (Pl.'s.
Resp. to Wells Fargo's MSJ 4). SFE explained its claim
that the purchase price of its certificates had diminished or
become worthless by stating that when the certificates were
first placed in SFE's account they were worth $163,875, that
the March 2007 account statement said they had a market
value of $141,214, and that the latest account statement
showed that the loss had increased to $25,464. (Pl.'s Resp.
to Wells Fargo's MSJ 8-9). To support this proposition, SFE
cited Charles Schwab account statements and the declaration
of Thomas Arjmandi. (SFE App. 576-97; 1571-72). In its
response to Orix's motion for summary judgment, SFE also
cited Orix's Motion to Compel Rule 26 Disclosures (doc. 268)
and Joint Status Report on Orix's Motion to Compel Rule 26
Disclosures (doc. 356) to show that Orix must concede that
the market value of the certificates has declined. (Pl.'s Resp.
to Orix's MSJ 9). In these documents, Orix stated:
[B]ased on information provided to the ORIX Defendants
and its own investigation of SFE's alleged claims, the ORIX
Defendants seriously question whether SFE's damage
claim complies with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure as SFE has actually made money on its purchase.
The certificates that SFE acquired for approximately
$165,000 are currently worth approximately $155,500 with
SFE already receiving approximately $31,500 in principal
and interest payments for a net profit of approximately
$22,000.

## Page 10

69 Fed.R.Serv.3d 986, RICO Bus.Disp.Guide 11,429
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 10
(doc. 268 at 2 n. 1). Orix also stated, “[B]ased on
the trading records, the certificates are currently worth
approximately $155,500 on the open market, with SFE
already receiving approximately $31,500 in principal and
interest payments.” (doc. 356 at 3).
With the exception of Thomas Arjmandi's declaration, 11
which the Court excluded in part II above, SFE has not
provided evidence that the value of its certificates has
decreased. SFE does not meet its burden of coming forward
with “specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for
trial” by citing excerpts from Orix's Motion to Compel Rule
26 Disclosures. Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587.  As in Riviera,
asking for money or reciting the purchase price does not
establish injury. 283 F.3d at 319.  Similar to the plaintiff in
Slowiak who conceded that his business had been profitable,
SFE has received all interest and principal payments on the
certificates that it is due. Slowiak, 987 F.2d at 1296;  Wells
Fargo App. 404. After saying that he did not know what SFE's
damages are, Thomas Arjmandi may now not defeat summary
judgment with a self-serving affidavit. Id. at 1297.  SFE has
not provided evidence and may not rest on “mere allegations”
at the summary judgment stage. Ford, 301 F.3d at 332-33.
Therefore, SFE does not satisfy the first element of Article III
standing-injury-in-fact.
*14  Furthermore, even if SFE can establish that the value
of the certificates has decreased, it has provided no evidence
that this decrease was caused by the Defendant's conduct as
opposed to fluctuations in interest rates and the declining
principal balance of the certificates. (Wells Fargo's Br. 17).
Wells Fargo explained that certificates trade for less over time
as a result of the repayment of principal and the reduction
of the principal balance. (Wells Fargo's Br. 16 (citing Decl.
of Thomas Biafore at App. 7)). The dominant factor in
valuing certificates is the fluctuation of interest rates which
during the time that SFE held the certificates made risk-free
debt valuable and would have caused the value of SFE's
certificates to decrease. (Wells Fargo's Br. 17 (citing Decl. of
Thomas Biafore at App. 7)). Finally, Wells Fargo claims that
the rating of the certificates and the security of the certificates
has improved since the conduct that SFE complained of was
reported in industry publications. (Wells Fargo's Br. 17(citing
Decl. of Barry S. Schwartz at App. 404)). SFE has the
burden of proving that its “injury” was not caused by factors
unrelated to the Defendants' activities. Wells Fargo pointed
out the lack of evidence of causation, and SFE did not provide
evidence. See Ford, 301 F.3d at 333.  Accordingly, SFE has
not met its burden of proving causation. The Court now turns
its attention to SFE's second claim of damages-disgorgement.
3. Standing Based on Disgorgement Damages for Breach
of Fiduciary Duty
SFE claims that it need not show injury in order to recover
disgorgement for breach of fiduciary duty. (Pl.'s Resp. to
Wells Fargo's MSJ 5). As discussed below in part III.D.3.,
the Court agrees that this proposition is correct under Texas
law. However, a state law cause of action that does not require
injury will not give a federal court jurisdiction when the court
lacks Article III standing:
Although standing requirements in state courts are often
less stringent than those of Article III, the issue lacks
relevance here, as standing in federal court is determined
entirely by Article III and depends in no degree on whether
standing exists under state law.
Int'l Primate Prot. League v. Admins. of the Tulane Educ.
Fund, 895 F.2d 1056, 1061 (5th Cir.1990)  (citing Phillips
Petroleum v. Shotts, 472 U.S. 797, 804, 105 S.Ct. 2965, 86
L.Ed.2d 628 (1985)), rev'd on other grounds, 500 U.S. 72, 111
S.Ct. 1700, 114 L.Ed.2d 134 (1991) , superseded by statute
on other grounds, 28 U.S.C § 1442(a)(1) (as amended 1996),
as recognized in Winters v. Diamond Shamrock,  149 F.3d
387, 397 (5th Cir.1998); see also 13A Charles Alan Wright,
Arthur R. Miller & Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and
Procedure § 3531.14  (“Of course state rules that recognize
standing need not be honored if Article III requirements are
not met.”).
The Second Circuit has held that the district court incorrectly
dismissed the complaint based on lack of standing when the
plaintiffs did not allege injury as a result of the defendant's
actions. Walton v. Morgan Stanley & Co., 623 F.2d 796, 798
(2d Cir.1980). The Court reasoned that Delaware law did not
require injury for a breach of fiduciary duty claim. Id. The
Court also stated:
*15  We need not address the question whether standing
in [a] diversity case is a matter of state or federal law,
for the recognition of standing of a shareholder to bring a
derivative suit for the profits made by one who allegedly
breached a fiduciary duty owed to the corporation accords
with both federal and Delaware notions of standing.
Id. at 798 n. 4. This Court need not decide whether to
apply the rule of Walton to a non-derivative breach of
fiduciary duty claim in the Fifth Circuit because, as discussed
below in part III.D .3, the Court has determined that SFE's
breach of fiduciary duty claim would fail on other grounds.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Wells Fargo's motion for

## Page 11

summary judgment on all of SFE's claims against Wells Fargo
and Orix. The Court turns next to Orix's motion for summary
judgment.
D. Orix's Motion for Summary Judgment-Lack of
Damages as an Element of SFE's Causes of Actions
1. SFE's RICO, Negligence, and Gross Negligence Claims
In the alternative, even if SFE could establish standing, the
results would be similar based on Orix's motion for summary
judgment. Orix argues that summary judgment is proper
because SFE has failed to provide evidence of an essential
element of each of its causes of action-damages.12 (Orix's Br.
13).
To establish RICO standing, a plaintiff must satisfy two
elements: (1) injury and (2) causation. Price v. Pinnacle
Brands, Inc.,  138 F.3d 602, 606 (5th Cir.1998) ; see also
Commercial Union Assurance Co. v. Milken, 17 F.3d 608, 612
(2d Cir.1994) (“[W]ithout provable damages, no viable RICO
cause of action may be maintained.”). In First, the plaintiffs'
RICO claim was based on the insurance company's mailing of
an allegedly fraudulent damages assessment report that “(1)
failed to consider the full extent of damage to their home and
(2) made improper repair recommendations.” First v. Allstate
Ins. Co.,  222 F.Supp.2d 1165, 1170, 1175 (C.D.Cal.2002) .
The insurance company had paid the plaintiffs $158,080.04
for the damage to their home, and the plaintiffs failed to
present evidence that the damage to their home exceeded
that amount. Id. at 1171.  The plaintiffs' expert opined that
the damage to the home was extensive, that the assessment
report was inaccurate and vague, and that “[b]ased on the
vagueness and inaccuracies noted in the ... report, any attempt
at determination of estimates to repair would be impossible.”
Id. The Court held that the plaintiffs could not survive
summary judgment on their RICO claim because there was no
triable issue of fact of whether they were injured by the report.
Id. at 1175; see also Waste Conversion, Inc. v. Rollins Envtl.
Servs. (NJ), Inc.,  1989 WL 79768, at * 7-8 (E.D.Pa.1989)
(holding that the plaintiff did not raise a genuine issue of
material fact as to the injury element of its RICO claim when
it alleged that it was injured in its business because it incurred
costs including the loss of its sales contract but did not submit
evidence of any costs).
*16  As for SFE's negligence claims, under Texas law, a
cause of action for negligence or gross negligence requires (1)
a legal duty owed by one person to another, (2) a breach of
that duty, and (3) damages proximately caused by that breach.
D. Houston, Inc. v. Love,  92 S.W.3d 450, 454 (Tex.2002)
(for elements of negligence); Bykowicz v. Pulte Home Corp.,
950 F.2d 1046, 1053 (5th Cir.1992)  (for elements of gross
negligence). Failure to show damages is an appropriate
ground for granting summary judgment on a negligence or
gross negligence claim. Johnson v. Brewer & Pritchard,  73
S.W.3d 193, 211 (Tex.2002)  (granting summary judgment
on negligence claim when plaintiff failed to show damage);
Gen. Star Indem. Co. v. Sherry Brooke RevocableTrust,
243 F.Supp.2d 605, 613 (W.D.Tex.2001)  (holding that lack
of summary judgment evidence of causation and damages
precludes a tort claim). In Weinberg, summary judgment was
appropriate on a Washington negligence claim based on lack
of damages when the plaintiff responded to interrogatories
that the amount of damages would be the subject of an expert
report and that he did not know what his damages were
but later did not update his answers. Weinberg v. Whatcom
County, 241 F.3d 746, 750, 752 (9th Cir.2001) . The Court
stated, “ ‘Summary judgment is appropriate where appellants
have no expert witnesses or designated documents providing
competent evidence from which a jury could fairly estimate
damages.’ ” Id. at 751  (quoting McGlinchey v. Shell Chem.
Co., 845 F.2d 802, 808 (9th Cir.1988)).
Having established that RICO and negligence claims require
evidence of damages, the Court concludes that SFE has
not met this requirement. As discussed above with respect
to SFE's standing, without Arjmandi's declaration, SFE
has failed to produce any evidence that it has been
damaged. Even if the Plaintiff's evidence of damages was
sufficient to survive summary judgment, SFE has produced
no evidence that its alleged damages were caused by the
Defendants'actions, which is a requirement of both a RICO
claim and a Texas negligence and gross negligence claim. 13
Accordingly, summary judgment is appropriate on SFE's
RICO, negligence, and gross negligence claims. The Court
will now consider the requirement of damages as it relates to
SFE's breach of contract claims.
2. SFE's Breach of Contract Claim
Under New York law regarding a breach of contract claim,
even if the plaintiff fails to raise an issue of material fact as
to actual damages, he or she may proceed to trial to recover
nominal damages. V .S. Int'l, S.A. v. Boyden World Corp., 1993
WL 59399, at * 8 (S.D.N.Y .1993); Hirsch Elec. Co., Inc. v.
Cmty. Servs., Inc., 145 A.D.2d 603, 536 N.Y .S.2d 141, 143
(N.Y .App.Div.1988) (citing Farnsworth, Contracts, § 12.8, at
838-839) (“[I]t is a well-settled tenet of contract law that even

## Page 12

69 Fed.R.Serv.3d 986, RICO Bus.Disp.Guide 11,429
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 12
if the breach of contract caused no loss or if the amount of loss
cannot be proven with sufficient certainty, the injured party
is entitled to recover as nominal damages a small sum fixed
without regard to the amount of the loss, if any.”). In Hirsch,
the Court held that the plaintiff's damages claim for lost profits
based on breach of contract was too speculative and limited
the plaintiff at trial to a claim for nominal damages. 536
N.Y .S.2d at 142. Because the Court has found that SFE has
not established damages, SFE would be limited to nominal
damages for breach of contract at trial.
3. SFE's Breach of Fiduciary Duty Claim
*17  SFE has correctly argued that a plaintiff need not
prove actual damages in order to recover disgorgement of
fees for the breach of a fiduciary duty. Burrow v. Arce,
997 S.W.2d 229, 239-40 (Tex.1999) . Therefore, SFE's lack
of evidence of damages will not preclude its breach of
fiduciary duty claim. However, the Defendants argue that
SFE must provide evidence that the Defendants have derived
a benefit resulting from or proximately caused by their
breaches of fiduciary duty. (Orix Reply 2-3; Wells Fargo's
Reply 3). Disgorgement is a remedial measure rather than
a punitive one and is limited to “property causally related
to the wrongdoing” at issue. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Receivable
Fin. Co., L.L.C., 501 F.3d 398, 413 (5th Cir.2007) (applying
Texas law) (citing SEC v. First City Fin. Corp.,  890 F.2d
1215, 1231 (D.C.Cir.1989)). “Accordingly, the party seeking
disgorgement must distinguish between that which has been
legally and illegally obtained.” Id.; see also Swinnea v.
ERI Consulting Engineers, Inc.,  236 S.W.3d 825, 2007 WL
2447057, at *11-*12 (Tex. App-Tyler 2007)  (“[A] fiduciary
must account for, and yield to the beneficiary, any profit
he makes as a result of his breach of fiduciary duty. As
explained above, Appellees did not prove any actual damages
or reasonably certain lost profits. Neither did Appellees
prove that Swinnea obtained any ill gotten gains at ERI's
expense. Therefore, there is no evidence to support an
award of damages for breach of fiduciary duty, equitable or
otherwise.” (citations omitted)). The Fifth Circuit recently
addressed this issue and held that because the plaintiffs did
not produce evidence regarding what amount of money the
defendant's obtained through their wrongdoing as opposed
to legitimate activities, the evidence was insufficient to
sustain a disgorgement damages award. 14 Allstate, 501 F.3d
at 414. The Court discussed the plaintiff's burden of proving
disgorgement damages:
In actions brought by the SEC involving a securities
violation, “disgorgement need only be by a reasonable
approximation of profits causally connected to the
violation.” However, “in a private action, the party seeking
monetary compensation may have a greater burden to
prove its claim to the amount requested.”
Id. at 413 (quoting First City, 890 F.2d at 1231, 1232 n.
24). The Court declined to determine whether a private
party was required to meet a more onerous burden
because it held that the plaintiff had not provided a
reasonable approximation of what was illegally obtained.
Id. This Court need not make that determination today
because it finds that SFE has not provided a reasonable
approximation of what Wells Fargo or ORIX obtained
as a result of the alleged breach of fiduciary duty. SFE
cites Corporate Interiors v. Pappas,  784 N.Y .S.2d 919,
at *6 (N.Y .Sup.Ct.2004) for the proposition that once
SFE presents prima facie evidence of the Defendants'
gains, the burden shifts to the Defendants to demonstrate
any legitimate costs because they are in the exclusive
possession of that information. (Pl.'s Resp. to Orix's MSJ
8). Here, as explained below, the Court finds that SFE has
not presented evidence “of the amount [the Defendants]
gained as a result of the breach” to establish prima facie
evidence of the Defendants' gains. Id.
*18  Turning to SFE's evidence of disgorgement damages,
SFE claims disgorgement of at least $8,032,907.01 from Orix
“in fees and interest on reimbursements for performing work
as master and special servicer of the MLMI and FULBBA
trusts since January 1, 2005.” (Pl .'s Resp. to Orix's MSJ
5-6). SFE supports this amount with Orix's response to an
interrogatory requesting the fees earned for each year from the
inception of the MLMI and FULBBA Trust to the present.15
SFE, in a footnote, claims that its disgorgement gains should
not be limited to this amount because the summary judgment
evidence reveals that Orix earned a higher amount of fees
and that Orix received benefits from its own investments
in the trusts as a result of its breach of fiduciary duty.
(Pl.'s Resp. to Orix's MSJ 6 n. 2). For this proposition,
SFE cites reports from its expert Victor Moore quantifying
amounts of servicing fees, special servicing fees, trustee fees,
reimbursement of interest on advances, and distributions on
the B pieces “as a result of the servicing relationship that was
technically a conflict of interest between the master servicer
(ORIX) and the special servicer (also ORIX).” (SFE App.
574-75).16 As for Wells Fargo, SFE claims disgorgement
fees of at least $360,460 “in fees since it began serving as
Trustee for the Trusts.” (Pl.'s Resp. to Wells Fargo's MSJ 5).

To support this claim, SFE cites the same expert report from
Victor Moore mentioned above and a chart identifying fees,
which Wells Fargo produced with its Responses to SFE's First
Set of Interrogatories. (SFE App. 573-75, 1543-45).
Other than Victor Moore's conclusory assertion that these
fees were a result of a conflict of interest, SFE offers no
evidence to connect all of the fees that Orix and Wells Fargo
have earned since the inception of the trusts to their alleged
breaches of fiduciary duty to SFE. As Wells Fargo points
out, “SFE cannot simply claim that sometime after SFE
became a certificate holder in 2005, Wells Fargo breached a
fiduciary duty and then recover every cent Wells Fargo has
earned for the indenture trustee services it has provided since
1999.” (Wells Fargo's Reply 3-4). Wells Fargo's fees were
fixed in the governing PSA's as a percent of the principal
balances of the loans in the trusts. ( Id. at 4). In conclusion,
because SFE has not offered a reasonable approximation
of what the Defendants have earned as a result of their
alleged breach of fiduciary duties, SFE is not entitled to
disgorgement. See Allstate, 501 F.3d at 413.  Accordingly,
Wells Fargo and Orix's motions for summary judgment on the
breach of fiduciary duty claims are granted.17
IV . Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS the
Defendants' motions to exclude the portion of Arjmandi's
declaration identifying the value of the certificates and
DENIES as Moot the motions to exclude other evidence. The
Court also GRANTS the Defendants' motions for summary
judgment on all of SFE's claims because SFE has failed to
meet its burden of establishing Article III standing. In the
alternative, even if SFE has established standing, summary
judgment would be appropriate on all of SFE's claims based
on lack of damages except for the breach of contract claims,
which would be limited to nominal damages.
*19  In light of the significant impact that this Order will have
on the case, the Court DIRECTS SFE and Orix and their lead
counsel to hold a face-to-face meeting to discuss settlement
of this case by January 15, 2008. By January 30, 2008, Orix
is ORDERED to notify the Court in writing of (1) whether
the parties have reached a settlement, and, if not, (2) whether
it intends to pursue its counterclaims against SFE. The Court
will defer disposition of SFE's motion for summary judgment
on Orix's counterclaims until that time. The trial setting and
the deadlines imposed by the scheduling order (doc. 469)
are also stayed until that time. Because Wells Fargo has no
counterclaims against SFE, Wells Fargo is DISMISSED from
this case.

1 On August 2, 2007, the Court dismissed Orix Capital Markets Partnership from the case pursuant to Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 4(m) (doc. 309).
2 The Court will use the following designations for the Defendants: (1) “Orix Defendants” includes Orix, Orix USA,
Dinan, Wurst, Weiner, and Thompson; (2) “Defendants” includes the Orix Defendants and Wells Fargo; (3) “Individual
Defendants” includes Dinan, Wurst, Weiner, and Thompson.
3 Both Wells Fargo and Orix point out that Orix foreclosed on a Louisiana apartment building which served as collateral for a
loan that was sold into the MLMI Trust. (Wells Fargo's Br. 5). This apartment building was owned by Cyrus II Partnership.
(Id.). Bahar Development, of which Mondona Rafizadeh was President, was the general partner of Cyrus II. (Id.). This
foreclosure resulted in a $10 million judgment against Mondona Rafizadeh, among others. (Id.). Approximately three
months later, SFE, which was incorporated by Mondona Rafizadeh's husband and is managed by her son and nephews,
purchased certificates in the MLMI Trust. (Id.). Three months after that, SFE purchased certificates in the FULBBA Trust.
(Id.).

4 While the Court has not relied on these arguments, Wells Fargo contends that Arjmandi is incompetent to testify because
he is neither an expert nor an owner of the certificates. (Wells Fargo's Reply 7). He also never represented that he was
familiar with the market value of the certificates, which Wells Fargo claims is a prerequisite to testimony by an owner. (Id.).
5 SFE listed the following categories of damages:“(a) Amounts overbilled to the MLMI and FULBBA Trusts, an amount in
excess of $10 million, for improper litigation expenses. (b) Amounts of improper fees, advancement reimbursements, and
interest paid to Defendants in an amount to be discovered. (c) The purchase price of the MLMI and FULBBA Certificates
purchased by Plaintiff in an amount of approximately $164,700. (d) All payments made to the ORIX Conspirator
Defendants with respect to their ‘B Pieces' after the date on which such certificates should have been ‘junked’ and to
the extent the losses sustained by the FULBBA and MLMI Trusts exceeded the par value of the B Pieces investment,
an amount to be discovered .(e) The amount of profits the ORIX Conspirators gained through sale of the improperly
inflated and continued ‘B pieces,’ an amount believed to be in excess of $20 million dollars. (f) Any other gains realized
from the breach of fiduciary obligations by Defendants, an amount to be discovered. (g) Amounts lost to the Trust as a
result of the performing loans which were foreclosed by ORIX with Wells Fargo's blessing, an amount to be discovered.
(h) Amounts gained by Defendants from improper foreclosure on performing loans or by reselling foreclosed properties
to itself or entities with which Defendants had an affiliation, an amount to be discovered .(i) The value of Wells Fargo's
‘Master Servicing Right’ assets attributable to its involvement with the MLMI and FULBBA Trusts, an amount to be
discovered.” (Orix App. 473; similar list at Wells Fargo Sealed App. 11).
6 SFE listed the following categories of damages: “(a) Amounts of master servicing, special servicing, trustee, and other
fees (such as modification fees, late charges, default interest, and defeasance fees), paid to Defendants in connection
with their activities for the MLMI and FULBBA Trusts, an amount exceeding $29,355,497. (b) Amounts of interest paid
to Defendants on advances and expenses (including principal and interest advances, litigation advances, and custodial
balances), an amount exceeding $1,865,814. (c) The purchase price of the MLMI and FULBBA Certificates purchased by
SFE, an amount of $165,000, or their diminishment in value, an amount no less than $24,700. (d) Distribution payments
made to the ORIX Defendants with respect to their ‘B Pieces,’ an amount no less than $20,000,000. (e) The amount of
profits the ORIX Defendants gained through sale of their ‘B pieces' in the MLMI and FULBBA Trust, an amount no less
than $40,000,000. (f) Amounts gained by Defendants from sale of collateral properties for liquidated loans not credited
to the Trusts, an amount no less than $4,500,000. (g) Any other gains or profits or benefits Defendants received in
connection with their activities for the MLMI and FULBBA Trusts, such as diverting settlement amounts through non-Trust
accounts or improper purchases of Trust assets. (h) Any tax penalties suffered by SFE as a result of improper actions
of the Defendants in connection with administering the Trusts. (i) The value of Wells Fargo's ‘Mortgage Servicing Right’
assets attributable to its involvement with the MLMI and FULBBA Trusts.” (Orix App. 478; Wells Fargo App. 1432).
7 SFE did not file a response to Orix or Wells Fargo's motion to strike evidence.
8 The Court need not consider the Defendants' other motions to exclude SFE's evidence because it finds in favor of the
Defendants on all of SFE's claims.
9 Orix cited Red Roof Inns, Inc. v. Murat Holdings, LLC, 2006 WL 2458563, at *5 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2006) for the proposition
that the tort claims should be governed by Texas law because they depend upon an “ ‘interpretation and enforcement’
of the PSA's.” However, this opinion was subsequently withdrawn and substituted with an opinion stating, “A choice
of law provision in a contract that applies only to the interpretation and enforcement of the contract does not govern
tort claims.” Red Roof Inns, Inc. v. Murat Holding, LL, 223 S.W.3d 676, 684 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2007, no pet. h.) (citing
Stier v. Reading & Bates Corp., 992 S.W.2d 423, 433 (Tex.1999)). In Red Roof Inns, the Court held that even though
the franchise agreement contained a choice of law provision in favor of Ohio law, the claims for tortious interference,
Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices Act violation, fraud/negligent misrepresentation, and breach of fiduciary duty would be
governed by Louisiana law. Id. at 685. The breach of fiduciary duty claim was based on the actions and statements
of the officers in inspecting the hotel and the fraud/negligent misrepresentation claim was based on failure to disclose
certain information. Id.
10 SFE appears to abandon its argument that its damages include potential tax consequences to the certificate holders
because it does not mention this alleged injury in its responses. SFE's expert has conceded that he is unaware that Wells
Fargo failed to comply with tax regulations to the detriment of the Trusts. (Wells Fargo App. 42).

11 In its response, SFE points to Arjmandi's declaration discussing the Charles Schwab account records and the Charles
Schwab account records themselves. (SFE App. 576-97). To the extent that SFE contends that the account records
alone are sufficient evidence of injury, the Court rejects this argument because these records should be excluded under
Federal Rule of Evidence 702. In Van Der AA Investments, Inc. v. Comm'r of Internal Revenue, 125 T.C. 1, at *4, 2005 WL
1580806 (T.C.2005), the Court refused to consider as evidence on a motion for summary judgment an Arthur Anderson
report describing the fair market value of the company. The report was supported by an affidavit of an officer of the
company stating that the company had engaged Arthur Anderson to determine this value. Id. The Court reasoned that
since the author had relied on specialized knowledge to prepare the report, it would not be admissible unless the author
was testifying as an expert. Id. at *6 (citing Fed.R.Evid. 702). Allowing the introduction of the report “would allow the
introduction of opinion testimony by lay witnesses in the form of a report as to scientific, technical, or other specialized
matters and would allow an expert to express his opinions in a report without being subject to cross-examination on the
facts and data underlying that opinion.” Id. In this case, admitting the Charles Schwab account records would allow SFE
to present evidence of the value of the certificates without giving the Defendants the opportunity to cross-examine the
author of the report. Wells Fargo made a similar argument with respect to Arjmandi's declaration. (Wells Fargo's Reply
7-8 (citing Fed.R.Evid. 702; Wilson v. Woods, 163 F.3d 935, 937 (5th Cir.1999)) (“Rather, he [Arjmandi] admits he simply
downloaded and presented as expert evidence account statements from Charles Schwab. In other words, rather than
presenting an expert whose opinions and methodology could be scrutinized, Mr. Arjmandi simply reads the opinion of a
third party [the Charles Schwab report] who proffers a ‘market value’ from time to time, without any explanation of how
that term is defined, how the opinion is developed or the qualification of the individual developing it. This is no evidence
and should be disregarded.”). Wells Fargo did not specifically raise this objection with respect to the Charles Schwab
account statements themselves; however, this Court may raise the issue of the admissibility of evidence sua sponte. See
United States v. Wallace, 972 F.2d 344, at *3. (4th Cir.1992).
12 The Court recognizes that there is a distinction between showing the existence of damages and quantifying those
damages and that a plaintiff need not present evidence quantifying its damages. Potomac Elec. Co. v. Electric Motor &
Supply, Inc., 262 F.3d 260, 265 (4th Cir.2001); see also Dyll v. Adams, 167 F.3d 945, 947 (5th Cir.1999) (applying Texas
law) (quoting McKnight v. Hill & Hill Exterminators, 689 S.W.2d 206, 207 (Tex.1985) (“Uncertainty as to the fact of legal
damages is fatal to recovery, but uncertainty as to the amount will not defeat recovery.”) However, the Court finds that
SFE has not provided sufficient evidence to show the existence of damages.
13 Wells Fargo moved for summary judgment on the ground that there was no evidence that their conduct caused the
alleged decline in the market value of the certificates, and Orix made this argument in its Reply Brief (Wells Fargo's Br.
16, Orix's Reply 5-6).
14 The standard for summary judgment mirrors the standard for a directed verdict and requires “sufficient evidence favoring
the nonmoving party for a jury to return a verdict for that party.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249-50,
106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).
15 The interrogatory stated: “Please state the amounts of monies paid by the MLMI Trust to ORIX Capital Markets, LLC as
Servicer and/or Special Servicer for each year the inception of the MLMI Trust to the present for each of the following:
(a) repayment of principal and interest (P & I) advances; (b) repayment of litigation expenses; (c) repayment of other
advances; (d) interest paid on P & I advances, advances for litigation expenses, and other servicing advances; (e)
fees for serving as master servicer; (f) fees for serving as special servicer and (g) any other fees or reimbursement of
expenses.” (SFE App. 1551-52). The interrogatory for the FULBBA trust was almost identical. (SFE App. 1558-59).
16 SFE also cites pages 237-76 of its appendix in support of disgorgement damages against Orix and Wells Fargo. This
citation is to several pages of graphs with no label or any explanation of what these documents are. The Court will
disregard this evidence.
17 Because the Court has granted the Defendants' motions for summary judgment on all of SFE's claims, it is unnecessary
for the Court to consider the other grounds for summary judgment.

MEMORANDUM ORDER
JANE J. BOYLE, United States District Judge.
*1  Before the Court are Defendant's Motion to Strike
Designated Expert (doc. 21) and Plaintiff's Amended Motion
to Exclude Expert Testimony (doc. 24). This suit arises out
of Allstate Insurance Company's denial of an insurance claim
that its insured, Dwight Glasgow, now deceased, made on a
homeowner's insurance policy for damage to his home caused
by fire. Allstate claims that Glasgow intentionally set the
blaze, and it denied coverage on that basis. Mitch Launius,
as independent administrator of Glasgow's estate, filed this
suit against Allstate for breach of the contract of insurance
between Glasgow and Allstate and for violations of the Texas
Deceptive Trade Practices Act and the Texas Insurance Code.
Allstate designated David Sneed, a fire consultant, as
an expert witness in this matter. Sneed conducted an
investigation of the fire on February 5, 2002 and issued a
report on April 2, 2002 regarding the origin and cause of
the fire. (App. to Def.'s Mot. to Strike Designated Expert
[“Def.App.”] at 2). Sneed concluded that the fire was set
intentionally through the introduction and ignition of gasoline
inside a 1988 Toyota Camry parked in Glasgow's driveway
and on top of a 1984 Oldsmobile Cutlass parked in the garage.
(Id. at 5-6). Launius seeks to exclude Sneed's testimony on
the basis that Sneed is not qualified to testify as an expert
witness and because his opinions are not reliable.
Launius has designated Gerald Hurst as an expert. Hurst has
a doctoral degree in chemistry from Cambridge University
and has over 30 years of experience in studying the initiation
and prevention of fires and in analyzing fires and explosions.
(App. to Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s Mot. to Strike [“Pl.'s Resp.App.”]
at 1). In his report Hurst primarily criticizes the observations
and findings of Sneed's investigation, and he puts forth
various alternative accidental causes of the fire. ( Id. at 2-8).
He stated at his deposition that he is “not certain about the
origin of this fire” ( id. at 25), but he states in his report
that “the most probable cause of the subject fire was the
ignition of a layer of dry leaves on the driveway surface
by either the exhaust system or the electrical system of the
Toyota automobile.” (Id. at 8). Allstate argues that Hurst is
not qualified to testify about fire investigation and that his
opinions are unreliable.
The Court finds that both Sneed and Hurst are qualified to
testify as expert witnesses. Under Federal Rule of Evidence
702, an expert must be qualified by knowledge, skill,
experience, training or education. Fed.R.Evid. 702. An expert
must possess a higher degree of knowledge or experience
about an issue than an ordinary person would. See Mukhtar
v. California State Univ.,  299 F.3d 1053, 1065 n. 9 (9th
Cir.2002), amended by 319 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir.2003) . Since
1997, Sneed has been certified as a fire investigator by
International Association of Arson Investigators (“IAAI”),
one of two organizations that certify fire instructors in the
United States. (App. to Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Am. Mot. to
Exclude Expert Testimony [“Def. Resp.App.”] at 14). Sneed
has worked as a fire consultant since 1996, focusing on the
investigation of losses due to fire, explosion, product liability
and fraud. ( Id. at 18). Launius suggests that Sneed is not
qualified to testify as an expert because he has no formal
higher-level education in chemistry or the physical sciences.
The mere lack of a academic training or formal college
education will not render expert testimony inadmissible,
however. See Dresser v. Cradle of Hope Adoption Ctr.,
Inc., 421 F.Supp.2d 1024, 1033 (E.D.Mich.2006) . “ Rule

## Page 2

Launius v. Allstate Ins. Co., Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2007)
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 2
702 specifically contemplates the admission of testimony
by experts whose knowledge is based on experience.” See
United States v. Parra,  402 F.3d 752, 758 (7th Cir.2005)
(quoting Smith v. Ford Motor Co.,  215 F.3d 713, 718 (7th
Cir.2000)). Sneed unquestionably has experience in the field
of fire investigation, and he accordingly is qualified to testify
on that subject at trial.
*2  For his part, Hurst has been self-employed since 1980 as
an explosion and fire analysis consultant. (Pl. Resp.App. at
1). In recent years he has analyzed fires in alleged arson and
arson/murder cases in various state and federal jurisdictions.
(Id.). Hurst is a member of the IAAI, but he is not a Certified
Fire Instructor. (Def.App. at 123-124). He is also a member
of the National Fire Protection Association and the American
Chemical Society. (Pl. Resp.App. at 26). The Court finds that
Hurst's educational background and experience has endowed
him with a higher degree of knowledge about the field of
fire investigation and/or analysis than a layperson and that his
testimony will accordingly assist the trier of fact to determine
the facts at issue in this case.
Each party also argues that the other's respective expert fails
to satisfy the reliability requirements of Daubert v. Merrell
Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,  509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786,
125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993) . The Court finds that the parties'
concerns over the presentation of “shaky” expert testimony
can be addressed through forceful cross examination and the
presentation of contrary evidence at trial. See Daubert, 509
U.S. at 596;  Mathis v. Exxon Corp.,  302 F.3d 448, 461 (5th
Cir.2002). “[I]f it becomes apparent in trial that some of
the testimony will not assist the trier of fact to understand
the evidence, [the parties] may object to such testimony.”
See Hidalgo v. Cooley Godward,  2004 WL 936859, at *3
(N.D.Tex. April 1, 2004).
For the foregoing reasons the Court DENIES Defendant's
Motion to Strike Designated Expert (doc. 21) and Plaintiff's
Amended Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony (doc. 24).
The Court further DENIES Plaintiff's original Motion to
Exclude Expert Testimony (doc. 19) as moot.

MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
JANE J. BOYLE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
*1  Before the Court are Defendants’ Motions to Strike the
Report and Opinions of Walter A. Guntharp, Jr. and Jason
Marcetti, M.D. (Docs. 53 & 56). Plaintiff commissioned
Mr. Guntharp to opine on Defendant Dorn Knapp's conduct
before, during, and after the accident, and Dr. Marcetti
on Plaintiff's future medical expenses. For the reasons that
follow, Defendants’ Motion to Strike the Report and Opinions
of Walter A. Guntharp, Jr. (Doc. 53) is GRANTED in part
and DENIED in part , and Defendants’ Motion to Strike
the Report and Opinions of Dr. Jason Marcetti (Doc. 56) is
DENIED.
I.
BACKGROUND1
On June 18, 2018, Susan Hanan was traveling on Interstate
45 in Navarro County, Texas, when her vehicle was hit by
Defendant Crete Carrier Corporation's tractor trailer. Doc.
4, Pl.’s Original Pet., ¶ 6. The vehicle was being driven by
Defendant Knapp, who was an employee of Crete at the
time. Id. Hanan further alleges that she was hit when “Knapp
changed lanes unsafely into the lane in which [Hanan] was
lawfully driving, crashing into [Hanan's] vehicle at a high rate
of speed.” Id.
Hanan subsequently brought this lawsuit against both Crete
and Knapp. Id. ¶¶ 4–5. Hanan alleges that she suffered severe
injuries to her head , neck, back, and other body parts as a
result of the accident. Id. ¶ 6.
Hanan originally brought six causes of action, five of
which survived Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment
(Doc. 42): (1) negligence and gross negligence against both
Defendants; (2) negligent hiring against Crete; (3) negligent
training against Crete; (4) negligent supervision, retention,
and monitoring against Crete; and (5) negligent entrustment
against Crete. See Doc. 91, Mem. Op. & Order, 2, 16.
To further her case, Hanan retained Mr. Guntharp and Dr.
Marcetti as experts. Mr. Guntharp, Jr. was commissioned to
opine on Mr. Knapp's conduct before, during, and after the
car accident in relation to commercial truck driving standards.
Doc. 71, Pl.’s App., Ex. C (Guntharp Report). Dr. Marcetti
was commissioned to opine on the amount of Hanan's future
medical expenses as a result of the car accident. Doc. 68, Pl.’s
App., Ex. C (Marcetti Report).
Defendants now move to exclude both Mr. Guntharp and Dr.
Marcetti's testimony (Docs. 53 & 56). All briefing has been
submitted, and the motions are now ripe for review.
II.
LEGAL STANDARD
Federal Rule of Evidence 702  provides for testimony by an
expert witness if: (1) that witness is “qualified as an expert
by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education”;
(2) “the expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized

knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the
evidence or to determine a fact in issue”; (3) “the testimony
is based on sufficient facts or data” ; (4) “the testimony is
the product of reliable principles and methods”; and (5) “the
expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to
the facts of the case.” Fed. R. Evid.  702. The “testimony is
admissible only if it is both relevant and reliable.” Kumho Tire
Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 141 (1999) (citing Daubert
v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc. , 509 U.S. 579, 597 (1993) ).
The party offering expert testimony bears the burden of
establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the
testimony satisfies Rule 702. See Mathis v. Exxon Corp., 302
F.3d 448, 459–60 (5th Cir. 2002).
*2  “The court decides these motions in its role as gatekeeper
concerning the admissibility of expert testimony.” Hall Arts
Ctr. Office, LLC v. Hanover Ins. Co. , 327 F. Supp. 3d 979,
1001 (N.D. Tex. 2018) (citing Pipitone v. Biomatrix, Inc., 288
F.3d 239, 244 (5th Cir. 2002)). “Vigorous cross-examination,
presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on
the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means
of attacking shaky but admissible evidence.” Daubert, 509
U.S. at 596.
III.
ANALYSIS
A. Walter A. Guntharp's Testimony
Mr. Guntharp opined that (1) Defendant Knapp was
intentional, or at the very least reckless, leading up to
the accident; (2) if not for Defendant Knapp's actions,
the accident would not have occurred; and (3) Defendant
Knapp did not comply with industry standards while driving
Defendant Crete's tractor trailer leading up to the accident.
See Doc. 71, Pl.’s App., Ex. C (Guntharp Report), 4–5.
Defendants raise four grounds to strike Mr. Guntharp's
testimony: Mr. Guntharp's opinions (1) do not show how
compliance with applicable federal and state laws and
industry standards are relevant to the case and “do not identify
or analyze any relevant laws, regulations, standards or
practices[;]” (2) improperly parrot and bolster the testimony
of fact witnesses; (3) “are speculative and not tied to the
facts through proper analysis[;]” and (4) offer accident
reconstruction conclusions for which Mr. Guntharp is not
qualified. Doc. 53, Defs.’ Mot., 1.
Hanan responds by arguing that: “(1) Mr. Guntharp's opinions
are reliable because there is no analytical gap between the
facts [of the case] and his opinions”; (2) Mr. Guntharp is
qualified to offer opinions in the case, and is not attempting
to reconstruct the scene of the accident; and (3) “virtually all
of Defendants” objections “go towards the weight, and not
the admissibility, of Mr. Guntharp's opinions.” Doc. 70, Pl.’s
Resp., 7–12.
The Court concludes that Mr. Guntharp's testimony as to
Defendant Knapp's state of mind and the cause of the accident
is inadmissible expert testimony and must be stricken from
the record. This includes all of conclusions (1), (2), (5),
(6), (7), (8), and (9), and portions of conclusions (3) and
(4). See Doc. 71, Pl.’s App., Ex. C (Guntharp Report), 4–
5. As to conclusion (3), Mr. Guntharp's conclusion that
“[i]nstead, with reckless disregard for the safety of Ms.
Hanan, [Defendant Knapp] operated his large tractor-trailer
in an aggressive manner that ultimately resulted in this crash”
must be stricken. See id. at 5. As to conclusion (4), the
Court strikes Mr. Guntharp's conclusions that “Mr. Knapp's
actions as described by witness Brown were representative of
road rage and an intentional attempt to prevent Ms. Hanan
from entering his lane of travel” and that “[t]hese actions ...
represented outrageous conduct on the part of Mr. Knapp.”
See id. Finally, conclusions (1) and (5) must be stricken as
well, as they are not helpful to a jury. See id.
1. Mr. Guntharp's opinions as to Defendant Knapp's state
of mind in conclusions (2), (7), and portions of conclusions
(3) and (4) are all inadmissible expert testimony and must
be stricken.
Conclusions (2), the above portions of (3) and (4), and (7)
all opine on Defendant Knapp's state of mind at the time
of the accident. See, e.g. , id. at 4–5, Conclusion (2) (“Mr.
Knapp intentionally attempted to prevent Ms. Hanan from
passing....”); Conclusion (3) (concluding that Knapp was
acting with “reckless disregard for the safety of Ms. Hanan);
Conclusions (4) and (7).
*3  “[A] trial court may strike expert testimony that
evaluates a party's state of mind, as that evaluation is within
the province of the jury.” Fisher v. Halliburton , 2009 WL
5216949, at *2 (S.D. Tex. Dec. 21, 2009)  (citing Marlin v.
Moody Nat'l Bank, N.A. , 248 F. App'x 534, 541 (5th Cir.
2007) (per curiam)). A trial court may do so because “[a]n
expert's credentials do not place him in a better position than
the [trier of fact] to draw conclusions about a defendant's state

Hanan v. Crete Carrier Corporation, Not Reported in Fed. Supp. (2020)

of mind.” Id. (alterations in original) (citing Marlin, 248 F.
App'x at 541).
In Fisher, the court considered expert testimony that opined
that a party “knew that the death or serious injury of its
drivers was substantially certain” and that the party's actions
“[rose] to the level of specific intent.” Id. at *3 . The court
concluded that these were “evaluations of the mental state of
the defendants’ employees” and were “not [ ] helpful to a trier
of fact....” Id. Accordingly, the court granted the motion to
strike the expert testimony. Id.
Here, the Court is confronted with the same type of testimony
as in Fisher. Mr. Guntharp's testimony concludes, for
example, that Defendant Knapp's actions were “intentional
attempt[s] to prevent Ms. Hanan from passing” and
“represented a conscious and reckless disregard for the safety
of Ms. Hanan.” Doc. 71, Pl.’s App., Ex. C (Guntharp Report),
4–5. The Court thus GRANTS Defendants’ motion to strike
(Doc. 53) the aforementioned conclusions on state of mind,
and all other portions of the report that opine on Defendant
Knapp's state of mind. See, e.g., id. at 6 (“Mr. Knapp ... acted
in a reckless manner....”).
2. Conclusions (1) and (5) do not require the testimony of
an expert and must be stricken.
Conclusion (1) of Mr. Guntharp's report states, “[o]n the
day of the crash, Mr. Knapp was in the scope of his
employment with Crete Carrier Corporation (Crete).” See id.
at 4. However, Mr. Guntharp does not explain the bases of
this conclusion anywhere in his report. See id. at 4–8. Thus,
this conclusion must be stricken. See Fed. R. Evid.  702(d)
(explaining that “the expert [must] ha[ve] reliably applied the
principles and methods [giving rise to his testimony] to the
facts of the case”).
Additionally, Conclusion (5) of Mr. Guntharp's report states,
in full:
After the crash, Mr. Knapp communicated via CB radio
with Mr. Brown, a truck driver who had witnessed the crash
and denied striking the Hanan vehicle. He then continued
down the roadway for approximately a mile before pulling
over onto the shoulder and awaiting the police.
Doc. 71, Pl.’s App., Ex. C (Guntharp Report), 5. Such facts
do not require the help of an expert for the jury to understand,
and thus this conclusion is inadmissible. See In re C.R. Bard,
Inc., 948 F. Supp. 2d 589, 608 (S.D. W. Va. 2013) (“Expert
testimony which merely regurgitates factual information that
is better presented directly to the jury rather than through
the testimony of an expert witness is properly excluded.”)
(quotations and internal citation omitted).
Thus, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion (Doc. 53) as
to conclusions (1) and (5) of Mr. Guntharp's testimony.
3. Mr. Guntharp's opinions that Mr. Knapp's actions were
the cause of the crash in conclusions (2), (3), (6), (7), (8),
and all of conclusion (9) must be stricken.
The Court strikes all conclusions as to the cause of the
crash. This includes portions of conclusions (2), (3), (6),
(7), and (8), and all of conclusion (9). See Doc. 71, Pl.’s
App., Ex. C (Gunhtarp Report), 4–5. Similar to the rationale
behind the bar on state-of-mind testimony explained above,
asking an expert witness to opine on the legal cause of an
accident “is [an] issue the jury must resolve....” Owen v. Kerr-
McGee Corp., 698 F.2d 236, 240 (5th Cir. 1983) . Although
Federal Rule of Evidence 704  allows testimony that might
“embrace[ ] an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of
fact,” id. at 240 (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 704), “the rule [is not]
intended to allow a witness to give legal conclusions.” Id. at
240 (emphasis in original).
*4  Yet, opining on legal conclusions is exactly what Mr.
Guntharp has done in his report. Like in Owen, “there [is]
no dispute in the evidence as to the factual cause of the
mishap,” which is the accident between Hanan and Defendant
Knapp. See id. ; see also  Doc. 43, Def.’s Br. in Supp. of
Mot. for Summ. J., 2 (“This lawsuit arises from a sideswipe
accident that occurred on June 18, 2018 between [Hanan]
and a Crete tractor trailer rig driven by Dorn Knapp.”). Thus,
it is “obvious” that Mr. Guntharp is attempting to opine on
whether Mr. Knapp's actions were the but-for and proximate
cause of the accident. See Owen, 698 F.2d at 239–40 . For
example, Mr. Guntharp concludes many times, using different
words, that “[h]ad Mr. Knapp acted in a safe, professional
manner, this crash would not have occurred.” Doc. 71, Pl.’s
App., Ex. C (Guntharp Report), 5. The Court will ask the jury
—not a witness, even one who is an expert—to make such
conclusions. See Owen, 698 F.2d at 240 (“Whether or not [the
plaintiff's] acts were the ‘cause of the accident’ is the issue
the jury must resolve....”).
For the foregoing reasons, Mr. Guntharp's testimony that
Mr. Knapp's actions caused the accident (or alternatively, if
Mr. Knapp did not act in a certain way, the accident would
not have occurred) must be stricken. The Court GRANTS
Defendants’ motion to strike (Doc. 53) to this extent.

4. Mr. Guntharp's opinions about whether Mr. Knapp
complied with driving standards in conclusions (3) and (4)
are admissible.
Mr. Guntharp's conclusions that Defendant Knapp did
not follow commercial driver standards before or during
the accident are admissible. This includes the following
conclusions:
3. The construction zone and associated traffic conflicts
required that a commercial driver be especially careful.
Mr. Knapp failed to meet this standard....
4. ... These actions are far outside the scope of industry
expectations....
Doc. 71, Pl.’s App., Ex. C (Guntharp Report), 5. Unlike
Mr. Guntharp's other conclusions and testimony, these
conclusions satisfy Rule 702 ’s requirements for expert
testimony. First, Mr. Guntharp is qualified as an expert. He
has worked as a field safety representative for a transportation
insurance company, and has provided defensive driving
courses to commercial drivers for the state of Indiana. Id. at
30. He has been involved in the commercial transportation
industry since 1976. Id.; see also Fed. R. Evid.  702 (listing
experience as one way in which someone can qualify as an
expert).
Next, in his report, Mr. Guntharp listed the materials relevant
to the accident that he reviewed, and the knowledge of
commercial driving standards that he has acquired through
his experience in the industry. See Doc. 71, Pl.’s App.,
Ex. C (Guntharp Report), 4–5; see also  Fed. R. Evid.  702
(explaining that to be admissible, expert testimony must
be “based on sufficient facts or data,” and “the product of
reliable principles and methods,” and the expert must have
“reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the
case”). Thus, the Court disagrees with Defendants’ arguments
that Mr. Guntharp “does not mention what these industry
standards are; where he found them; how they have been
tested, applied or otherwise shown to be reliable; how they
are relevant to this case; or how he analyzed or evaluated
Defendants’ compliance with them.” Doc. 54, Def.’s Br.,
7–8. Instead, Defendants’ arguments go to the weight, not
the admissibility, of Mr. Guntharp's testimony. See Lofton v.
McNeil Consumer & Speciality Pharms., 2008 WL 4878066,
at *4 (N.D. Tex. July 25, 2008)  (refusing to exclude expert
testimony when the “validity of expert testimony ... [was] a
question of weight, not admissibility”) (citation omitted).
Additionally, Defendants argue that “Defendants’ general
compliance with regulations, practices and standards is not
relevant to this lawsuit.” Doc. 54, Defs.’ Br., 3. The Court
disagrees. Compliance with standards of care in an industry
is relevant to whether a defendant breached the standard
of care in a negligence case. See Idar v. Cooper Tire &
Rubber Co., 2010 WL 3702579, at *3 (S.D. Tex. Sept. 15,
2010) (“In negligence claims, courts often look to compliance
with industry standards to determine if a defendant was
negligent.”) (citation omitted).
*5  Consequently, the Court DENIES Defendants’ motion
to strike (Doc. 53) insofar as it seeks to strike Mr. Guntharp's
testimony related to Defendant Knapp's noncompliance with
commercial driving standards.
B. Dr. Jason Marcetti's Testimony
Dr. Marcetti testified that Ms. Hanan's future medical
requirements would be $302,680.61. Doc. 68, Pl.’s App.,
Ex. C (Marcetti Report), 1. Dr. Marcetti included in his
calculations (1) physician services; (2) routine diagnostics;
(3) medications; (4) laboratory studies; (5) rehabilitation
services; and (6) acute care services. Id.
Defendants raise two grounds to strike Dr. Marcetti's
testimony. Defendants note that when calculating Hanan's
future medical expenses, Dr. Marcetti failed to analyze (1)
charge rates by Hanan's specified providers; and (2) the
availability of Medicare. Doc. 57, Defs’ Br., 3–6. Thus,
Defendants argue that Dr. Marcetti's expert testimony is not
reliable as required by Daubert. Id. at 5.
First, Defendants believe that in calculating the cost of
Hanan's future medical care, Dr. Marcetti failed to consider
Hanan's “insurance status and the rate negotiated by the
provider with the insurer.” Id. at 4 (citing Haygood v. De
Escabedo, 356 S.W.3d 390, 393–94 (Tex. 2011)). Defendants
argue that such considerations are required under Texas
law, specifically that “recovery of medical or health care
expenses incurred is limited to the amount actually paid or
incurred....” Doc. 57, Defs.’ Br., 4 (citing Tex. Civ. Prac.
& Rem. Code Ann.  § 41.0105 ). Defendants suggest that by
failing to take into consideration what Hanan's providers
will actually charge, or what Hanan will actually pay, Dr.
Marcetti's “methodology is not reliable and his analysis is not
relevant or helpful to the jury in this case....” Id. at 4–5.
Second, and relatedly, Defendants contend that in his
calculations, Dr. Marcetti does not account for the fact that

## Page 5

 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 5
Hanan is a Medicare recipient. Id. at 5. Thus, Defendants
believe, Dr. Marcetti's opinion “is not based on and does
not relate to the facts at issue and is not relevant to any
issue in the case.” Id. Defendants rely on Haygood v. De
Escabedo, where the Texas Supreme Court concluded that
imposing damages on a defendant based on expenses that a
health care provider would not be entitled to charge would
“create a windfall for the plaintiff and is inconsistent with the
concept of compensatory damages.” Doc. 57, Defs.’ Br., 5
(citing Haygood, 356 S.W.3d at 396–97).
The Court finds Defendants’ arguments unavailing. As Hanan
points out, and Defendants concede, Haygood and Section
41.0105 set out rules for past, not future, medical expenses.
See Doc. 67, Pl.’s Resp., 13–14; Doc. 78, Defs.’ Reply, 3.
Defendants argue in their reply that their “argument is not
simply a Section 41.0105 argument.” Doc. 78, Defs.’ Reply,
3. But that's not what they say in their original brief on this
motion. See Doc. 57, Defs.’ Br., 4 (“That is, Marcetti does not
show, as required by § 41.0105, what charges [Hanan] will
actually pay or incur for her future care.”) (emphasis added).
Nor is the Court persuaded by Defendants’ argument that
“there is no principled reason why, when [information
regarding Medicare and insurance status, among other
factors] is available for future medical expenses, such factors
should not be considered for future costs as well.” Doc. 78,
Defs.’ Reply, 4. Such considerations are not required under
Texas law. “In order to recover for future medical expenses
under Texas law, the plaintiff must show there is a reasonable
probability that such medical expenses will be incurred in
the future.” Koenig v. Beekmans , 2017 WL 7732809, at *3
(W.D. Tex. Mar. 23, 2017). Thus, the standard for calculating
past medical expenses is different than that for future medical
expenses. In Koenig, the defendants argued that the plaintiff's
expert did not consult with the plaintiff's medical providers,
but instead used a database “to establish projected medical
costs.” Id. The court there rejected this as a basis for striking
the expert, as the plaintiff had evidence that the expert's
methodology in calculating the future costs was “sound.” Id.
*6  Here, Dr. Marcetti did use Hanan's select providers in
calculating future medical expenses. See Doc. 68, Pl.’s App.
Ex., C. (Marcetti Report), 6–12. And Dr. Marcetti identified
the sources from which he obtained the predicted medical
costs. See, e.g., id. at 30–32 (calculating the average cost of
various medications in the Dallas area); cf. Albert ex. rel Doe
v. U.S. Dep't of the Army , 2019 WL 5783420, at *3 (W.D.
Tex. Nov. 5, 2019)  (striking part of the expert's testimony
on future medical costs because the expert failed to identify
the “sources regarding costs associated with other [anticipated
future] treatments”).
Defendants’ issue is with how Dr. Marcetti used Hanan's
select providers in calculating her medical expenses. This
argument goes to the weight, not the admissibility, of Dr.
Marcetti's testimony. See Koenig, 2017 WL 7732809, at *3
(rejecting the motion to strike because “[w]hether or not
the estimate costs of future medical care are made based
on [local] rates goes to the weight not the admissibility of
the testimony” ). Defendants’ reply proves as much: they
believe that the Medicare and other factors should have been
considered by Dr. Marcetti. Doc. 78, Defs.’ Reply, 4. But,
“[a]s a general rule, questions relating to the bases and sources
of an expert's opinion affect the weight of the evidence rather
than its admissibility, and should be left for the finder of fact.”
Koenig, 2017 WL 7732809, at *3.
Thus, the Court DENIES Defendants’ motion to exclude Dr.
Marcetti's testimony (Doc. 56).
IV .
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ motion to strike the
testimony of Mr. Guntharp (Doc. 53) is GRANTED in
part and DENIED in part . The parts of Mr. Guntharp's
report that opine on Defendant Knapp's state of mind and
whether his actions were the cause of the accident are
STRICKEN. Additionally, conclusions (1) and (5) are also
STRICKEN. However, the Court DENIES the motion to
strike Mr. Guntharp's report as it relates to Defendant Knapp's
noncompliance with commercial safety standards. It is further
ORDERED that Defendants’ motion to strike the testimony
of Dr. Marcetti (Doc. 56) is DENIED.
SO ORDERED.
