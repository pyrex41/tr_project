hereby grants the motion with respect to the first opinion
addressing credibility of the witnesses and the third opinion
addressing policy (far outside the norm) and denies the
motion with respect to the use of force opinion of the LVNR.
At trial the Court will again look at the use of force issue in
light of the evidence and reconsider the ruling.
