MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
JANE J. BOYLE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
*1  Before the Court is Plaintiff Hanan's Motion to Exclude
Expert Opinion or in the Alternative Motion in Limine (Doc.
96). Defendants Crete Carrier Corporation and Dorn Knapp
retained Andrew Irwin to give expert opinion and testimony
on accident reconstruction. Hanan moves to exclude Irwin's
testimony for alleged failures to abide by Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure 16, 26, and 37. Doc. 96, Pl.’s Mot., 1. For the
reasons that follow, Hanan's Motion to Exclude Irwin's Expert
Opinions (Doc. 96) is DENIED. Also, the Court DENIES the
Motion in Limine to exclude Mr. Irwin's testimony entirely
but reserves judgment on excluding the testimony regarding
the late-disclosed materials until the pre-trial conference.
However, the Court GRANTS a two-month continuance of
the trial date, so that Hanan may properly review the late-
disclosed expert evidence. The Court will enter a further order
with the specific trial and pre-trial conference dates.
I.
BACKGROUND
This is a personal injury case in which Hanan alleges she was
traveling on Interstate 45 in Navarro County, Texas, when
her vehicle was hit by Defendant Crete Carrier Corporation's
tractor-trailer. Doc. 4, Supp. Doc. (“Original Pet.”), ¶ 6. The
vehicle was being driven by Defendant Knapp, who was an
employee of Crete at the time. Id. Hanan alleges that she
suffered severe injuries to her head , neck, back, and other
body parts as a result of the accident. Id. Hanan subsequently
brought this lawsuit against both Crete and Knapp. Id. ¶¶ 4–5.
The Court issued a Scheduling Order (Doc. 10) on March
6, 2019 that set Defendants’ expert designation and reports
deadline for June 19, 2019. Doc. 10, Scheduling Order,
1. The Court then extended Defendants’ expert designation
deadline to October 16, 2019. See Doc. 30, Electronic Order.
Defendants retained Mr. Irwin as an expert in accident-
reconstruction modeling. Doc. 45, Defs.’ Designation of
Experts, 6. Defendants designated Irwin as a testifying
expert on accident reconstruction and produced his report on
October 16, 2019, in accordance with the expert designation
deadline. See id. But on November 21, 2019 and December
3, 2019, Defendants produced additional materials that Mr.
Irwin reviewed in formulating his expert report. Doc. 96, Pl.’s
Mot., 3–4. This was more than one month after the October
16 expert designation deadline had passed. Hanan alleges that
this late disclosure violated Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
16, 26, and 37. Id. at 2.
The contents of the late disclosure are: a data download from
the engine control module (ECM) on Crete's tractor-trailer;
additional photographs taken by Mr. Irwin; Mr. Irwin's notes
from his investigation; a dash cam video from a responding
officer; and supplemental materials. Id. at 4.
Hanan served her First Requests for Admission on
Defendants on March 15, 2019. Id. Request for Admission
Sixteen asked Defendants to admit that the tractor-trailer
driven by Defendant Knapp had an ECM device. Id. at 5.
Defendant Knapp admitted there was such a device installed
at the time of the accident. 1 Doc. 102, Defs.’ Resp., 5.
Along with that request, Hanan served Defendants with a
Request for Production of ECM data from Crete's tractor-
trailer. Doc. 96, Pl.’s Mot., 5. Defendant Knapp claimed
that because he was not in possession or control of the
vehicle, he personally had no ECM data to provide. Doc. 102,
Defs.’ Resp., 5–6. Similarly, Defendant Crete responded that
no ECM download had been completed. Id. at 6. At some
later point, however, a download was apparently performed
because Mr. Irwin reviewed the vehicle's ECM data download
during his investigation. See id.  at 4. But Crete neither
amended its response nor supplemented the ECM data within

the discovery deadline. See Doc. 96, Pl.’s Mot., 5; Doc. 102,
Defs.’ Resp., 6.
*2  Hanan now brings this motion to exclude Irwin's
expert testimony. Doc. 96, Pl.’s Mot. All briefing has been
submitted, and the motion is now ripe for review.
II.
LEGAL STANDARD
A. Disclosure of Expert Testimony—Rule 26(a)(2)(A)
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2)(A) , a party
who retains an expert to provide testimony in a case
must disclose the expert's identity. This disclosure must
be accompanied by an expert report that contains: (1) a
complete statement of all the expert's opinions and the reasons
for them; (2) the facts or data the expert considered in
forming his opinions; (3) any exhibits he used to summarize
or support those opinions; (4) the expert's qualifications,
including publications from the past ten years; (5) a list of
other cases the expert has provided expert testimony in
during the previous four years; and (6) a statement of the
expert's compensation in the instant case. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)
(2)(B)(i)–(vi).
Generally, a party must designate its experts and disclose its
expert reports “at the times and in the sequence that the court
orders.” See id. 26(a)(2)(D). “The parties must supplement
these disclosures when required under Rule 26(e).” Id. 26(a)
(2)(E). Rule 26(e) requires supplementation if: (1) “the party
learns in some material respect the disclosure ... is incomplete
or incorrect,” and (2) “additional or corrective information
has not otherwise been made known to the other parties
during the discovery process or in writing” by the time
pretrial disclosures are due. Id. 26(e)(1)(A) . This creates a
duty to supplement disclosures discovered to be incomplete
or incorrect, not an opportunity to provide information
previously omitted. See Sierra Club, Lone Star Chapter v.
Cedar Point Oil Co. Inc. ,73 F.3d 546, 571 (5th Cir. 1996)
(“The purpose of rebuttal and supplementary disclosures is
just that—to rebut and to supplement. These disclosures are
not intended to provide an extension of the deadline by
which a party must deliver the lion's share of its expert
information.”)
B. Failure to Properly Disclose—Rule 37(c)(1)
If a party fails to provide information as required under
Rule 26(a) or (e) , it may not use that information or
witness to “supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or
at a trial, unless the failure was substantially justified or
is harmless.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1) . Courts have broad
discretion in deciding whether a Rule 26(a) or (e)  violation
is substantially justified or harmless. Overbeck v. Envoy
Air, Inc. , 2017 WL 3726781, at *2 (N.D. Tex. Aug. 29,
2017) (citation omitted). In exercising its discretion, the
Court considers four factors: (1) the reason for the failure
to properly disclose; (2) the importance of the testimony;
(3) the potential prejudice in allowing the disclosure; and
(4) the availability of a continuance to cure such prejudice.
Geiserman v. MacDonald, 893 F.2d 787, 791 (5th Cir. 1990)
(citation omitted).
C. Scheduling Orders—Rule 16
Courts may enter scheduling orders under Rule 16 to manage
the timing of discovery and organize important dates in the
litigation. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 16. Barrett v. Atl. Richfield Co.,
95 F.3d 375, 380 (5th Cir. 1996) . Scheduling orders limit
the time period to amend pleadings and conduct discovery.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(3)(A). If a party fails to obey a court's
scheduling order, “[o]n motion or on its own, the court may
issue any just orders, including those authorized by Rule 37(b)
(2)(A)(ii)–(vii).” Id. 16(f)(1) . A court may “prohibit[ ] the
disobedient party from supporting or opposing designated
claims or defenses, or from introducing designated matters
in evidence.” Id. 37(b)(2)(A)(ii) . A trial court has “broad
discretion” in determining whether to sanction the offending
conduct. See Hodges v. United States , 597 F.2d 1014, 1018
(5th Cir. 1979) . Because failure to comply with Rule 16
provides for sanctions under Rule 37, the Court must apply
the same four-factor Geiserman analysis to Rule 16 violations
that it applies to Rule 26 violations. See Barrett, 95 F.3d at
380.
III.
ANALYSIS
*3  The Court now considers whether to exclude Mr. Irwin's
expert testimony as a Rule 37 sanction for violating either
Rules 16 or 26, or in the alternative limine out the testimony.
First the Court must determine whether the alleged conduct
actually violated Rules 16  or 26, and if so, whether the

violation was substantially justified or harmless under the
Geiserman factors. See Geiserman, 893 F.2d at 791.
In sum, although the exclusion of Mr. Irwin's testimony is not
warranted, the Court concludes that a two-month continuance
of the trial is necessary for Hanan to properly review the at-
issue documents in preparation for trial.
A. Rule 26
Defendants’ late disclosure of some materials Mr. Irwin
reviewed in creating his report was clearly untimely and
in violation of Rule 26 . However, after considering the
Geiserman factors, the Court finds that the violation can be
best cured through a continuance, not exclusion of Mr. Irwin's
testimony.
1. Defendants’ reason for noncompliance
First, the Court considers “the reason for [Defendants’]
failure to properly disclose” materials Mr. Irwin reviewed in
his investigation and formulation of his expert report. See
Geiserman, 893 F.2d at 791  (citation omitted). Defendants
contend that the untimely disclosure was unintentional
because the materials “did [not] form the basis of the
substance of Mr. Irwin's report.” Doc. 102, Defs.’ Resp.,
6. However, oversight is not an adequate excuse for
noncompliance with Rule 26; there is no requirement that the
violation was willing or intentional. See 1488, Inc. v. Philsec
Inv. Corp., 939 F.2d 1281, 1288–89 (5th Cir. 1991) (holding
no abuse of discretion when district court found the first factor
in favor of the movant where there was no argument that the
failure was intentional and no adequate justification given).
Accordingly, this factor weighs in favor of Hanan.
2. Importance of the disclosure
Next, the Court evaluates “the importance of the testimony”
of Defendants’ expert witness to the case. See Geiserman,
893 F.2d at 791  (citation omitted). The Court considers the
importance of the expert testimony as a whole because that is
what Hanan seeks to exclude, not the late-disclosed material.
See Doc. 96, Pl.’s Mot., 6. Defendants argue, and Hanan
does not dispute, that this testimony is important to the case.
See Doc. 102, Defs.’ Resp., 7–8; Doc. 96, Pl.’s Mot., 9. Mr.
Irwin is the only expert designated by Defendants to discuss
accident reconstruction, which is of particular importance in
this car-wreck case. See Doc. 102, Defs.’ Resp., 7–8.
While Hanan makes no argument that the testimony is
unimportant, she does argue that if Mr. Irwin's testimony
is essential, than the more important it is that the proper
procedures were followed. See Doc. 96, Pl.’s Mot., 9 (citing
Geiserman, 893 F.2d at 791 ). By this, the Court believes
that Hanan is intending to argue that the more important the
testimony, the more heavily this factor should weigh in favor
of the movant.
However, this is not the intended interpretation of the second
factor because it conflates it with the prejudice factor below,
and it “stand[s the analysis] on its head.” See Betzel v.
State Farm Lloyds , 480 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir. 2007) .
Because Hanan does not dispute the importance of the expert
testimony, this factor weighs in favor of Defendants.
3. Potential prejudice
*4  The Court next considers the “potential prejudice in
allowing the testimony.” See Geiserman, 893 F.2d at 791
(citation omitted). Hanan argues that she would be prejudiced
by Mr. Irwin's testimony because she does not have “a
reasonable amount of time to analyze all of the documents
and their factual connections to Mr. Irwin's report” before
trial. Doc. 96, Pl.’s Mot., 9–10. The late disclosures contained
multiple different types of materials, so the prejudicial effect
of each will be considered individually.
The largest portion of the materials is about 300 pages of
an ECM data download from the tractor-trailer. Id. at 4.
Defendants argue that the late disclosure of the data was not
prejudicial because Mr. Irwin determined it did not contain
recordings or data from the subject accident. Doc. 102, Defs.’
Resp., 8. But Hanan is entitled to make that determination for
herself and glean any other information she may find relevant
from the data. Hanan is not required to take the word of the
opposing party's expert that the data is not important to the
case. If she feels that she has not had time to review the data,
then it would be prejudicial to not allow her that opportunity,
as her time constraints are the result of Defendants’ mistakes.
Next, the disclosures contained over 100 photographs taken
by Mr. Irwin in his investigation. Doc. 96, Pl.’s Mot.,
4. Defendants claim that these were surplus pictures that
disclosed no new information because the photos Mr. Irwin
based his opinions on were included in his report. Doc. 102,
Defs.’ Resp., 3. Additionally, Defendants say Hanan would
not be prejudiced because the subject matter of the photos
have been available for Hanan to inspect herself throughout

discovery. Id. at 2. The Court agrees that Hanan has not shown
how she is prejudiced by the tardy disclosure of these photos.
The disclosures also contained Mr. Irwin's notes from his
investigation leading up to his report. Doc. 96, Pl.’s Mot., 4.
Defendants argue that this did not prejudice Hanan because
these notes helped Mr. Irwin create his report, which was
timely produced. Doc. 102, Defs.’ Resp., 3. Hanan makes no
specific showing of how this late disclosure may lead to a
prejudicial effect. See Doc. 96, Pl.’s Mot., 9–10. Thus, the
Court cannot find Hanan was prejudiced by the late disclosure
of Irwin's ten pages of notes.
The last item2 in the late disclosures was a dash-camera video
from the vehicle of an officer responding to the scene of
the accident. Id. at 4. The video shows the path of travel
down the section of the highway relevant to the dispute. Id.
Hanan does not allege that the footage shows the accident.
See Doc. 96, Pl.’s Mot., 4. Instead, Mr. Irwin used the footage
to create a scale diagram of the accident scene. See Doc. 103,
Defs.’ App., Ex. 16 (Irwin Report), 4. However, this video
could show whether Mr. Irwin used the wrong segment of the
highway, or included too much or too little of the segment
in his diagram. Hanan should have the ability to make such
arguments at trial if she deems necessary.
The Court believes that, at the very least, the late disclosure
of the ECM data download and the dash-camera video was
prejudicial and is deserving of a remedy.
4. The availability of a continuance
*5  Finally, the Court determines “the availability of a
continuance to cure such prejudice.” See Geiserman, 893 F.2d
at 791 (citation omitted). The Fifth Circuit has “repeatedly
emphasized that a continuance is the preferred means of
dealing with a party's attempt to designate a witness out
of time.” Betzel, 480 F.3d at 708  (quoting Campbell v.
Keystone Aerial Surveys, Inc. , 138 F.3d 996, 1001 (5th
Cir. 1998) ). Although here, the Court is confronted with
deficiencies in expert disclosures, not expert designations,
the Court finds that a continuance would be proper to cure
Hanan's insufficiency of time to review the materials pre-trial.
Consequently, the Court DENIES Hanan's Motion to Exclude
(Doc. 96) as it seeks to strike Mr. Irwin's testimony for any
noncompliance with Rule 26 and instead GRANTS a two-
month continuance.
B. Rule 16
The Rule 16 allegation relates to some of the same materials
(such as the ECM download) as in the prior section, but the
alleged offending conduct differs. See Doc. 96, Pl.’s Mot., 9.
Defendants’ production of materials outside the appropriate
period set by the scheduling order was a violation of Rule 16.
Although this is a separate Rule violation, the applicable test
is the same as the preceding section because they are both
Rule 37 violations. See Barrett, 95 F.3d at 380.
Defendants do not explain their failure to supplement their
response to Hanan's Request for Disclosure. Instead, they
claim that this was not violative conduct because Hanan
did not request that they do the ECM download after their
response that one had not been performed. Doc. 102, Defs.’
Resp., 6. However, Defendants had a duty to supplement
this answer with disclosure of the ECM data when it was
downloaded. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e)(1)(A) . Their reason
for noncompliance is not convincing. See Fed. R. Civ. Pro.
26(e)(1)(A). Like before, the first factor—Defendants’ reason
for noncompliance—weighs in favor of Hanan. The analysis
under the remaining three factors is the same as the preceding
section; thus, a separate analysis is not required. As such, the
Court finds that the violation will be best cured through the
continuance granted in the preceding section. Thus, the Court
DENIES Hanan's motion to exclude Mr. Irwin's testimony
(Doc. 96) for violating Rule 16.
C. Motion in Limine
Alternatively, Hanan requests that Mr. Irwin's expert opinion
be excluded as in limine relief. See Doc. 96, Pl.’s Mot., 10–11.
Granting or denying a motion in limine is within the district
court's discretion. Hesling v. CSX Transp., Inc. , 396 F.3d
632, 643 (5th Cir. 2005) (citation omitted). The Court refuses
to entirely bar the testimony and opinions of Mr. Irwin as
limine relief for the same reasons outlined in Part A. Instead,
the Court is willing to address further argument at the pre-
trial conference on the potential exclusion of the untimely
disclosed materials.
IV .
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Hanan's motion (Doc. 96) is
DENIED. However, the Court ORDERS a two-month
continuance of the trial. The Court will enter a further order
with the specific trial and pre-trial conference dates.

1 Hanan claims a “Defendant” denied the existence of an ECM device but does not specify which defendant. See Doc. 96,

2 Hanan also alleges that thirty-five pages of “supplemental materials” were in the late disclosures but never describes
the content, and neither party makes an argument regarding them. See Doc. 96, Pl.’s Mot., 4. Thus, the Court will not
analyze any of these “supplemental materials.”
