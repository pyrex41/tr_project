MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
JANE J. BOYLE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
*1  Before the Court are Defendant Home Depot U.S.A.,
Inc. (“Home Depot”)'s Motions to Strike the testimony of
Plaintiff Milton Allen's experts Laura Lampton (Doc. 47) and
Dr. Shubha Bhat (Doc. 49). For the following reasons, the
Court DENIES each motion.
I.
BACKGROUND
This is a personal injury case. Allen alleges injuries sustained
on the premises of his former employer, Home Depot, while
acting in the scope of his employment. Doc. 1-5, Original
Pet. ¶¶ 7-10. Allen sued Home Depot in Texas state court
in December 2023, asserting one count of negligence. Id. at
¶¶ 12-15. Home Depot removed the state action to this court
in February 2024, asserting diversity jurisdiction under 28
U.S.C. § 1332(a). See Doc. 1, Notice Removal.
Dr. Shubha Bhat is a board-certified family medicine doctor
who has served as Allen's primary care physician since 2015.
Doc. 50, Br. Mot. Bhat ¶¶ 4, 6. In his expert disclosures,
Allen listed Dr. Bhat as a non-retained expert witness. Doc.
53-2, App. Resp. Bhat, 4. Allen anticipates calling Dr. Bhat
—and other non-retained witnesses—to testify as to Allen's
injuries, including their cause, extent, and diagnosis, as well
as to treatments received or needed in the future. Id. at 5.
Specifically, Dr. Bhat could testify that Allen's injuries stem
from his alleged accident at Home Depot; that Allen received
medical treatment to his back, right ankle, hip, and knees;
and that Allen will need hip and knee replacements in the
future. Id. at 5-6. Home Depot requests that the Court limit
Dr. Bhat's testimony regarding the necessity of future knee
and hip replacements. Doc. 50, Br. Mot. Bhat ¶ 10; Doc. 59,
Reply Bhat ¶ 2.
Ms. Lampton is a registered nurse with a bachelor's degree
in nursing. Doc. 48, Br. Mot. Lampton ¶¶ 3, 4. She is also a
certified life care planner. Id. In his expert disclosures, Allen
listed Ms. Lampton as a retained expert witness. Doc. 53-2,
App. Resp. Bhat, 6. Relevant here, Ms. Lampton could testify
regarding Allen's life care plan, related medical expenses,
and projections for future medical expenses including those
attributed to knee and hip replacement. Doc. 48, Br. Mot.
Lampton ¶ 4; see Doc. 55-2, App. Resp. Lampton, 15. Home
Depot requests that the Court limit Ms. Lampton's testimony
insofar as it relies on Dr. Bhat's assessment of Allen's need
for knee and hip replacement. Doc. 48, Br. Mot. Lampton
¶ 6. Home Depot also requests that the Court preclude any
testimony by Ms. Lampton regarding the costs associated
with Allen's loss of capacity to perform household services.
Id. ¶ 7.
The Court considers the Motions below.
II.
LEGAL STANDARD
Federal Rule of Evidence 702  permits an expert witness
to testify if: (1) that witness is “qualified as an expert by
knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education”; (2) “the
expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge
will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to
determine a fact in issue”; (3) “the testimony is based on
sufficient facts or data” ; (4) “the testimony is the product
of reliable principles and methods”; and (5) “the expert's
opinion reflects a reliable application of the principles and
methods to the facts of the case.” FED. R. EVID.  702 .
Expert “testimony is admissible only if it is both relevant

and reliable.” Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137,
141 (1999) (citing Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509
U.S. 579, 597 (1993) ). The party offering expert testimony
bears the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the
evidence that the testimony satisfies Rule 702. See Mathis v.
Exxon Corp., 302 F.3d 448, 459-60 (5th Cir. 2002).
*2  “The court decides these motions in its role as gatekeeper
concerning the admissibility of expert testimony.” Hall Arts
Ctr. Off., LLC v. Hanover Ins. Co., 327 F. Supp. 3d 979, 1001
(N.D. Tex. 2018) (Fitzwater, J.) (citing Pipitone v. Biomatrix,
Inc., 288 F.3d 239, 244 (5th Cir. 2002) ). “[T]he trial judge
must ensure that any and all scientific testimony or evidence
admitted is not only relevant, but reliable.” Daubert, 509 U.S.
at 589 . “ Rule 702  ... clearly contemplates some degree of
regulation of the subjects and theories about which an expert
may testify.” Id. Thus, “[a] district court should refuse to
allow an expert witness to testify if it finds that the witness
is not qualified to testify in a particular field or on a given
subject.” Huss v. Gayden, 571 F.3d 442, 452 (5th Cir. 2009)
(citation omitted).
III.
ANALYSIS
According to Home Depot, Dr. Bhat's testimony as to the
cause of, or need for, knee or hip replacement is unreliable
because, as a general practitioner, she is not qualified to render
an opinion on those issues. Doc. 50, Br. Mot. Bhat ¶ 13. And if
Dr. Bhat's testimony is unreliable, Ms. Lampton's estimates as
to hip and knee replacement expenses are likewise unreliable
because they are based on Dr. Bhat's testimony. See Doc.
48, Br. Mot. Lampton ¶ 6. Because the Court finds that
Dr. Bhat's testimony is reliable, the Court DENIES Home
Depot's Motions to Strike Dr. Bhat's testimony on Allen's
need for knee and hip replacement (Doc. 49) and Home
Depot's Motion to Strike Ms. Lampton's testimony on Allen's
expenses related to knee and hip replacement (Doc. 47).
Home Depot also claims that Ms. Lampton's testimony
regarding costs attributable to loss of capacity to perform
household services is “irrelevant” because Allen cannot
recover those costs as a matter of law. See Doc. 48, Br. Mot.
Lampton ¶ 7. Because the Court finds that such damages
are recoverable and estimates related to those damages are
relevant, the Court DENIES Home Depot's Motion to Strike
Ms. Lampton's Testimony on Allen's future costs due to loss
of capacity to perform household services (Doc. 47).
A. Dr. Bhat's Testimony as to Allen's Need for Knee and Hip
Replacement is Reliable.
First, the Court denies Home Depot's Motion to Strike
Dr. Bhat's testimony regarding the need for knee and hip
replacement. “ Rule 702  does not mandate that an expert
be highly qualified in order to testify about a given issue.
Differences in expertise bear chiefly on the weight to be
assigned to the testimony by the trier of fact, not its
admissibility.” Huss, 571 F.3d at 452  (citation omitted)
(emphasis added). “[I]t is an abuse of discretion for a trial
court to exclude expert witness testimony on the ground
that the witness is not qualified to render the opinion at
issue because the witness lacks a certain educational or other
experiential background.” United States v. Wen Chyu Liu, 716
F.3d 159, 167 (5th Cir. 2013) (citation omitted). “Nonetheless,
before admitting the testimony, the court must also gauge
whether the ‘witness's qualifying training or experience, and
resultant specialized knowledge, are sufficiently related to the
issues and evidence before the trier of fact that the witness's
proposed testimony will help the trier of fact.’ ” Id. (citation
omitted).
Home Depot contends that Dr. Bhat is not qualified to
render an opinion as to Allen's need for hip and knee
replacement surgeries because she is a general practitioner
whose specialization is family medicine. Doc. 50, Br. Mot.
Bhat ¶ 13. According to Home Depot, such opinions are
better left to orthopedic surgeons or neurosurgeons, and Dr.
Bhat is Allen's only treating physician to determine that such
replacements are necessary. Id. ¶ 16. Allen disagrees. He
notes that while Dr. Bhat is not a specialist in orthopedics,
she has been his primary care physician for over ten years,
serving as one of his primary treating providers since the
alleged incident. Doc. 54, Resp. Bhat ¶ 3.
*3  In support of its position, Home Depot points to
Cleveland ex rel. Cleveland v. United States, where the Fifth
Circuit found no abuse of discretion when the district court
ruled that a doctor specializing in internal medicine was not
qualified to offer “his opinion on the standard of care owed
by emergency room physicians.” 457 F.3d 397, 405 (5th Cir.
2006). The Fifth Circuit explained that emergency medicine
is a specialty of its own, and while a specialist in internal
medicine could be qualified to testify as to its own standard
of care, the plaintiff had not shown that the two specialties'
standards of care were the same. Id. at 406. Notably, the Fifth

## Page 3

Allen v. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc., Slip Copy (2025)
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 3
Circuit's determination turned on its application of Louisiana
state law that required, “[w]hen the claim of malpractice
turns on the negligence of a specialist, only those qualified
in that specialty may offer expert testimony and evidence
of the applicable standard of care.” Id. (internal quotation
omitted). In other words, the Cleveland court was applying
state substantive law to a medical malpractice claim—not
conducting a pure Rule 702 analysis as is required here. See
id.1
A better analogue is Huss, where the Fifth Circuit considered
whether a doctor specializing in internal medicine was
qualified to testify to the cause of heart disease in the plaintiff.
571 F.3d at 453. The district court determined at trial that the
doctor was not qualified and excluded his testimony because
—despite the doctor's experience in treating patients with
heart disease  as part of his internal medicine practice, the
doctor's education, the doctor's familiarity with the plaintiff's
records, and the doctor's familiarity with medical literature on
the subject—the doctor did not have “experience or training”
enabling him to say that the administration of a particular drug
“did or did not probably cause” heart disease. Id. The Fifth
Circuit disagreed and held that the doctor “did not need be
board-certified in cardiology or toxicology to explain that the
studies relied on by the [plaintiffs] do not prove a causative
relationship.” Id. at 455 . The doctor's general “training and
experience as a medical professional” qualified him to tell a
jury that the literature on the subject did not “establish a causal
link” between certain medication and heart failure. Id. Thus,
the doctor did not need “to be specialized in cardiology or
toxicology to act as a counterpoint to the [plaintiffs'] experts”
and the district court had abused its discretion in excluding the
doctor's testimony. Id; see also Holbrook v. Lykes Bros. S.S.
Co., Inc., 80 F.3d 777, 782 (3d Cir. 1996) (“[I]t is an abuse of
discretion to exclude testimony simply because the trial court
does not deem the proposed expert to be the best qualified or
because the proposed expert does not have the specialization
that the court considers most appropriate.”).
Home Depot asks this Court to limit Dr. Bhat's testimony
because Dr. Bhat is not a specialist in orthopedics. This alone
is an insufficient basis to exclude an otherwise qualified
medical professional's testimony. See Wen Chyu Liu , 716
F.3d at 167 (explaining that a trial court abuses its discretion
where it excludes an expert's testimony solely on the
grounds that the witness “lacks a certain educational or
other experiential background”) (internal citations omitted);
Holbrook, 80 F.3d at 782 . The Court's gatekeeping function
does require consideration of whether Dr. Bhat's “qualifying
training or experience” is “sufficiently related to the issues
and evidence.” See Wen Chyu Liu, 716 F.3d at 167. Dr. Bhat is
a board-certified physician who has personally treated Allen
for the past ten years—both before and after the alleged
incident—and has personal knowledge of Allen's physical
condition before and following the various procedures Allen
has already undergone. Doc. 57-1, App. Supp., Ex. B., 3-6. As
Allen's longtime treating physician with personal knowledge
of the incident in question here, Dr. Bhat is qualified to form
an expert opinion on whether further medical procedures
could be required.
*4  There are open questions as to the weight of Dr. Bhat's
medical opinion. But “ Rule 702  does not mandate that an
expert be highly qualified in order to testify about a given
issue.” Huss, 571 F.3d at 452. “Vigorous cross-examination,
presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on
the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means
of attacking shaky but admissible evidence.” Daubert, 509
U.S. at 596 (citation omitted).
B. Ms. Lampton's Testimony as to Estimates of Knee and Hip
Replacement Costs are Reliable.
Next, the Court denies Home Depot's Motion to Strike Ms.
Lampton's testimony as to the costs associated with knee and
hip replacement.
Ms. Lampton is an experienced registered nurse and certified
life care planner, Doc. 48, Br. Mot. Lampton ¶¶ 3, 4, but
she does not independently determine whether her patients
require future medical procedures, see Doc. 47-1, App.
Mot. Lampton, Ex. A, 26. Instead, she relies heavily on
the medical opinions provided by competent physicians in
projecting her patient's future medical expenses. Id. Thus, in
adding knee and hip replacement costs to Allen's medical
expense estimates, Ms. Lampton relied entirely on a letter
from Dr. Bhat stating that knee and hip replacements would
be necessary in the first place. Id. at 28. As a result,
Ms. Lampton's reliability as an expert on Allen's projected
medical expenses depends in part on the reliability of Dr.
Bhat. See Doc. 48, Br. Mot. Lampton ¶ 19.
Because the Court finds that Dr. Bhat can reliably testify
on Allen's need for knee and hip replacement, and because
Home Depot does not otherwise challenge Ms. Lampton's
qualifications or experience as a nurse and life care planner,
the Court finds that Ms. Lampton's estimates of Allen's future
medical costs—and specifically future costs attributable
to knee and hip replacement—are reliable. As with Dr.

Bhat, Home Depot can press its arguments regarding the
weight of Ms. Lampton's testimony through “vigorous cross-
examination” and the “presentation of contrary evidence,” but
cannot exclude otherwise admissible expert testimony. See
Daubert, 509 U.S. at 596.
C. Ms. Lampton's Testimony as to Cost Estimates of Loss of
Household Services is Relevant.
Finally, the Court denies Home Depot's Motion to Strike Ms.
Lampton's testimony on loss of household services costs.
Home Depot claims that Ms. Lampton's testimony on costs
attributed to loss of household services is irrelevant because
Allen individually has no standing to recover those costs as
damages. Doc. 48, Br. Mot. Lampton ¶ 20. According to
Home Depot, injured parties cannot bring loss of household
services claims because they are only available to non-injured
spouses. Id. ¶¶ 20-21. Allen's costs for loss of household
services would thus be irrelevant, as Allen's spouse did not
join the action or otherwise bring a separate claim. See id.
In support of this proposition, Home Depot cites Whittlesey
v. Miller, 572 S.W.2d 665 (Tex. 1978); Critical Path Res. v.
Cuevas, 561 S.W.3d 523 (Tex. App.—Houston [14 th Dist.]
2018, pet. granted, judgm't vacated w.r.m.) , supplemented,
582 S.W.3d 348 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2018); and
City of Denton v. Page , 683 S.W.2d 180, 206 (Tex. App.—
Fort Worth 1985, rev'd on other grounds). However, none of
Home Depot's identified cases preclude injured parties from
seeking loss of household services damages.
In Whittlesey, the Texas Supreme Court considered whether
a wife had an independent action for loss of consortium from
her husband's injury. 572 S.W.2d at 665 . While Whittlesey
briefly discussed loss of household services, it did so to note
that claims for loss of “ ‘services’ rendered by a spouse to
the marriage” are separate from loss of consortium claims. Id.
at 666. Moreover, the Whittlesey court expressly stated that
unlike loss of consortium, which is a distinct loss suffered
only by the non-injured spouse, id. at 667, loss of the “services
of the spouse” to perform household and domestic duties is
“recoverable as a damage to the community ,” id. at 666 n.2
(emphasis added).
*5  As Allen has pointed out, the Court is not alone in this
understanding of Whittlesey. See Doc. 56, Resp. ¶ 13. In Suh
v. Tyson Foods, Inc. , the injured plaintiff wanted monetary
compensation for her loss of capacity to perform household
services, and the defendant argued that only the spouse of
an injured party—not the injured party herself—may raise
a claim for loss of household services. No. 4:19-CV-00409-
O, 2020 WL 13490747, at *1-3 (N.D. Tex. June 2, 2020)
(O'Connor, J.). The court found that under Whittlesey, a loss
of household services claim is communal, meaning either the
injured party or their non-injured spouse could raise it. Id.
at *3-4. The court noted that while it may be more common
for a non-injured spouse to raise derivative loss of household
services claims, there are also cases in which injured parties
successfully brought those claims themselves. Id. (citing
Ching Enters., Inc. v. Barahona , 2008 WL 4006758 (Tex.
App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2008, no pet.) ; Hancock Fabrics,
Inc. v. Martin, 596 S.W.2d 186 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th
Dist.] 1980, writ ref'd n.r.e.)) (additional citations omitted).
Home Depot's other proffered cases likewise provide little
support for its argument. While Cuevas explained that “[a]
claim for loss of household services is derivative in nature[,]”
it was only to explain that the claim depends on proving
a separate “serious, permanent, and disabling” injury. See
561 S.W.3d at 566 . In Cuevas, the court addressed a non-
injured spouse's loss of household services claim but did not
at any point imply that the injured spouse could not also
have brought the claim. See id.  In Page, the court stated
that “a cause of action for loss of household services is
based on the loss of the services of the injured spouse” and
accordingly found that contributory negligence could limit
both the negligence and derivative loss of household services
claims. 683 S.W.2d at 206. But as in Cuevas, the Page court
considered a loss of household services claim by a non-
injured spouse and did not address whether the injured spouse
could also have brought the claim. See id.
Because the Court finds that Texas law does not preclude
Allen from bringing a loss of household services claim,
Ms. Lampton's testimony as to the cost of loss of capacity
to perform household services is relevant. Home Depot's
motion to strike Ms. Lampton's testimony as to lost household
services is denied.
IV .
CONCLUSION
For the reasons discussed above, the Court DENIES Home
Depot's Motion to Strike the testimony of Dr. Bhat (Doc. 49)
and Home Depot's Motion to Strike the testimony of Ms.
Lampton (Doc. 47).

1 Home Depot also cites a variety of Texas state cases where an expert's testimony was precluded based on their lack
of experience or expertise in a particular specialization. See, e.g., Larson v. Downing, 197 S.W.3d 303, 305 (Tex. 2006);
Milkie v. Metni, 658 S.W.2d 678, 679-80 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1983, no writ); Broders v. Heise, 924 S.W.2d 148, 152-53
(Tex. 1996). These state cases apply Texas rules of evidence and are not binding on this court. Moreover, like Cleveland,
they are readily distinguishable from the issue presented here.
