SANCTIONS ORDER
JANE J. BOYLE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
*1  Before the Court are Defendant Regional Adjustment
Bureau, Inc.’s (RAB's) Motion for Sanctions, pursuant to
Fed. R. Civ. P. 37  (doc. 119) (“ Rule 37  Motion”)and
Motion for Sanctions Under 28 U.S.C. § 1927  (doc. 120)
(“§ 1927 Motion”).1 RAB, represented by attorneys Robbie
Malone (“Malone”) and Eugene X. Martin (“Martin”),
seeks sanctions against Plaintiff's attorney Noah Radbil
and Radbil's former employer, the Weisberg & Meyers
law firm(“Weisberg”),2 for misconduct RAB claims Radbil
engaged in during the pendency of this case. More to
the point, RAB accuses Radbil and his firm of a litany
of litigation abuses, foremost of which is that Radbil and
Weisburg engaged in a pattern of prevarication and outright
misrepresentations to the Court and counsel throughout
the case. RAB further maintains that Radbil and Weisburg
deliberately failed to timely and accurately disclose their lay
witnesses, their damage calculations and their experts; only
to later “ambush” RAB with the withheld information at
trial.3
For their part, Radbil and Weisburg deny they engaged in
any of the alleged misconduct, and maintain that all of RAB's
allegations are refuted by the record.4
The Court begins its discussion of the sanctions motions by
summarizing the factual and procedural background of the
case.
I.
CASE BACKGROUND
A. Factual and Procedural
This is a debt collection case. As detailed in previous court
filings, Plaintiff, Timothy White, is a counselor for a Dallas-
based surrogacy agency called Simple Surrogacy. Among his
degrees, he obtained a Bachelor of Arts from the University
of Texas at Austin in 1998 and a Master of Arts from Ball
State University in 2000. 5 Plaintiff financed his 1998 and
2000 degrees through student loans. He consolidated his
student loans with non-party Sallie Mae, which transferred
the consolidated loan to non-party Texas Guaranteed Student
Loan Corporation (“TG”). TG hired Defendant Regional
Adjustment Bureau, Inc. (“RAB”) to provide debt-collection
services with regard to TG's student loans. Plaintiff did not
meet his repayment obligations, and in August 2010, TG
referred Plaintiff's loan for $148,000 to RAB for collection.
Thereafter, RAB commenced collection efforts. This suit
followed.
Plaintiff's suit against RAB centers on RAB's conduct in
attempting to collect on the debt White owed to TG.
Specifically, the Complaint against RAB alleges four causes
of action: violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices
Act (“FDCPA”), 15 U.S.C. §§ 1692c(a)(2) and (3),1692d(6),
and 1692e(11); the Texas Debt Collection Practices Act
(“TDCPA”), Tex. Fin. Code §§ 392.304(a)(4) , (a)(5)(B), (a)
(19), and 392.404(a); the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices
Act (“DTPA”), Tex. Bus. & Com. Code § 17.50(h) ; and the
Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”), 47 U.S.C.

§ 227(b)(1)(A)(iii) .6 In connection with his claims, White
sought statutory damages, actual damages, treble damages,
pre– and post-judgment interest, and attorney's fees and
costs.7
*2  The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.8
After review, the Court awarded summary judgment to White
on his claims that Defendant violated the FDCPA, 15 U.S.C.
§§ 692d(6) and 1692e(11) (on the February 17, 2011 and
March 11, 2011 calls), and the TDCPA, Tex. Fin. Code §§
392.304(a)(4) and (a)(5)(B) (on the February 17, 2011 and
March 11, 2011 calls). The Court awarded summary judgment
to Defendant on Plaintiff's claims that Defendant violated
the FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1692c(a)(2)  and 1692e(11) (on
the March 15, 2011 call), the TDCPA, Tex. Fin. Code §
392.304(a)(5)(B) (on the March 15, 2011 call) and 392.304(a)
(19), as well as the DTPA, Tex. Bus. & Com. Code § 17.50(h).
As to Plaintiff's claims under the FDCPA, based on 15 U.S.C.
§ 1692c(a)(3) , and under the TCPA, based on 47 U.S.C.
§ 227(b)(1)(A)(iii) , the Court found that genuine issues of
material fact precluded summary judgment in favor of either
party. At trial, the Court issued a directed verdict dismissing
Plaintiff's TCPA, 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(1)(A)(iii)  claim.9 The
remaining claim, under the FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. § 1692c(a)(3),
was submitted to the jury following a three-day trial.
On February 28, 2013, the jury returned a verdict determining
that Defendant RAB did not violate § 1692c(a)(3) .10 The
issue of damages on the claims Plaintiff prevailed on at
summary judgment was also submitted to the jury. The jury
awarded no damages of any kind to Plaintiff on the claims
for which he was awarded summary judgment. 11 The Court
entered Judgment on March 12, 2013, stating that Plaintiff
take nothing by his suit against Defendant and dismissing the
case at Plaintiff's costs. 12 In a subsequent order, the Court
granted RAB's motion for costs as the prevailing party in the
case under Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)  but denied its request for
attorney's fees under Rule 54.13
As mentioned RAB filed two post-trial motions for sanctions
against Radbil and his firm. RAB's sanctions motions and the
testimony from the hearings are summarized below.
II.
RAB'S MOTIONS FOR SANCTIONS
Rule 37  Motion—Failure To Disclose Plaintiff's Actual
Damages, Counseling Efforts and Experts
Shortly after the jury trial ended, RAB filed its Rule 37
motion in which it argued that, during discovery, Radbil failed
to disclose and otherwise misrepresented key information
sought by RAB on three evidentiary issues. The first of these
regards Plaintiff's damages. RAB claims that, in Plaintiff's
initial disclosures and at his pretrial deposition, he stated he
incurred only $1500 in actual damages, and sustained no out-
of-pocket costs. RAB asserts that it relied on this information
in preparing for trial only to have Radbil “ambush” it with
undisclosed damages evidence at trial. Radbil did this, RAB
maintains, by offering testimony at trial from Plaintiff that
he had, in fact, incurred $40,000 in excess loan fees due to
RAB's conduct and that he had sustained another $5000 in
actual damages when he “had to drop [teaching] a class” due
to the stress caused by RAB's collection efforts.14
Second, RAB maintains that, despite Plaintiff's representation
in his pretrial disclosures that he had received no professional
counseling as a result of RAB's debt collection activities, 15
at trial—much to the surprise of RAB—Radbil attempted to
introduce evidence that Plaintiff had sought counseling due
to RAB's collection efforts.16 RAB maintains that the entry of
this ‘surprise’ evidence was an attempt by Radbil to deprive
it of its ability to defend itself on the issue of whether Plaintiff
had incurred damages due to counseling efforts.
*3  Third, RAB claims that Radbill made an untimely
attempt to add previously undisclosed witnesses 17 to
Plaintiff's witness list—some of whom appeared to be
potential experts—even though the expert designation
deadline of June 4, 2012 had long passed. RAB states it filed
objections to these new disclosures18 focusing in particular
on the undisclosed experts. Radbil responded on February
13, 2013 (in doc. 90), to RAB's pretrial motion to strike
experts (see doc. 75), by denying experts would testify in the
following statement to the Court:
Expert testimony is not required for Dr. White to
prove the actual damages that he suffered as a result
of RAB's legitimately abusive, deceptive, and harassing
debt collection practices, several of which this Court
has determined violate the FDCPA and TDCA as a
matter of law. No experts have been designated by either

party in this case and, therefore, there are none to
strike. RAB's motion is frivolous, serves only to multiply
proceedings unnecessarily, and should respectfully be
denied.19 (emphasis added).
Less than one week later, however, on February 18, 2013
and just days before trial, RAB notes that Radbil stated
in Plaintiff's response (doc. 95) to RAB's objection to
Plaintiff's pretrial disclosures (doc. 76), that 20 “... [c]ontrary
to [RAB's] claims and speculative argument, Dr. White ...
timely disclosed each fact witness—one of whom will provide
expert testimony....”21 (emphasis added).
Radbil denies all of the foregoing allegations in RAB's
Rule 37  Motion, insisting that: “... (1) Dr. White
disclosed the counseling and treatment through his original
interrogatory answers and deposition testimony, 22 (2) Dr.
White supplemented his disclosures and discovery responses
with his actual damages; and that (3) Dr. White's counsel
neither intended to, nor did, offer any expert testimony at
trial.”23
In its Reply, RAB hotly disputes the version of events
offered by Radbil in his Response. As to the damages issue,
RAB maintains that Radbil's claim that Plaintiff's disclosures
“placed RAB on notice of a significantly higher measure of
actual and economic damages” is flatly contradicted by the
record which includes, inter alia, White's December 15, 2011
deposition testimony.24
As to the counseling efforts, RAB, again, in its Reply,
references specific portions of White's December 15, 2011
pretrial deposition testimony contradicting Radbil's account
and substantiating RAB's position that White never disclosed
any counseling efforts prior to trial. Specifically, RAB
refers to Plaintiff's pretrial deposition where its counsel
asked Plaintiff whether he undertook any counseling efforts
(resulting from RAB's debt collection activities). White
answered that he had not talked to his doctor or any other
healthcare provider about RAB's debt collection activity. 25
RAB further points to White's deposition testimony that he
had never discussed his panic attacks with any healthcare
provider other than Dr. Cush, his rheumatologist. 26 RAB
further notes that White testified at his deposition that he
had not sought counseling from Dr. Cush or any other
psychologist or psychiatrist.27 As further evidence that Radbil
had not disclosed White's counseling efforts prior to trial,
RAB refers to an interrogatory asking White the following
question:
*4  INTERROGATORY NO. 23 : If you likely will
require medical and/or psychiatric treatment in the future
with respect to the symptoms of stress and/or mental
anguish alleged in Plaintiff's Original Petition, state the
name and address of each person who has advised you that
you will likely require medical and/or psychiatric treatment
in the future, the treatment you will likely receive, the date
such treatment will likely be received, and the cost of such
future medical and/or psychiatric treatment.
To which White answered:
ANSWER: None. Plaintiff hereby expressly reserves the
right to supplement this response throughout the continuing
course of discovery
So far as Radbil's contention in his Response that White
had testified “extensively” at his deposition about counseling
he sought at Texas A&M, RAB again strongly discounts
Radbil's contention, referring the Court to White's deposition
in which he testified that the extent of his counseling at
A&M was scheduling an appointment and then cancelling the
appointment and not rescheduling or following through with
any counseling.28
Finally, RAB notes that Radbil failed to even address in his
Response why he gave his inconsistent responses to the Court
in docs. 90 and 95 in his pretrial filings regarding his intent
to present expert testimony.29
§ 1927 Motion
In its § 1927  Motion, RAB complains about conduct by
Radbil and his firm that spans the pretrial, trial and post-
trial phases of this case. RAB maintains that Radbil and the
Weisberg firm “unreasonably and vexatiously multiplied the
proceedings in this case” by refusing to make a settlement
demand, failing to cooperate during discovery and by
withholding discoverable information. RAB further charges
that Radbil and the Weisberg firm filed unnecessary motions
and delayed the course of trial with disingenuous objections
and obstructionist trial tactics. 30 RAB further grounds its §
1927 Motion on Radbil and Weisburg's general “dishonest”
conduct toward the Court and counsel.31
Radbil and the Weisberg firm deny all of RAB's accusations
and oppose sanctions under § 1927.

To sum up, the foregoing litany of allegations against Radbil
and Weisberg in RAB's motions paint a troubling picture
of misconduct by Radbil and his firm during the pendency
of this case. The seriousness of the events described in the
motions, the bulk of which were witnessed by the undersigned
during the proceedings, prompted the Court to schedule an
evidentiary hearing on the motions.32 Unfortunately, instead
of resolving any of the issues, the hearing served only to
expand the Court's concerns about Radbil and Weisburg/
Meyers. Put simply, what started as a single hearing on
whether sanctions should be ordered on RAB's motions,
morphed into an multi-hearing inquiry by the Court about the
overall tactics and ethics of Radbil and the Weisberg firm.
III.
EVIDENCE AND FACTUAL FINDINGS
Evidence Considered—Generally
A considerable portion of the evidence relied on by the
Court in deciding the sanctions motions was derived from
the trial and sanctions proceedings themselves. Specifically,
transcripts of the pretrial, trial and post-trial sanctions
hearings—over which this Court presided—constitute a
significant part of the evidentiary record on the sanctions
issue. In addition, the parties submitted a multitude of exhibits
appended to their briefing on the sanctions motions as well
as numerous exhibits admitted at the sanctions hearings. The
transcripts, the briefing and the exhibits—along with the
Court's first-hand observation of the proceedings—form the
evidentiary basis for the Court's credibility determinations,
its findings of fact and for its ultimate finding that Radbil
and Weisburg partner Marshall Myers engaged in bad faith
conduct warranting sanctions.
*5  It is also important to note at the outset of the
Court's evidentiary review that the unusually large volume
of evidence submitted by the parties, combined with the
convoluted and inconsistent nature of Radbil and Myers'
defenses to the accusations, made organizing the proof
challenging at best. In fact, so inconsistent were Radbil's
defenses to the accusations during the trial and at the
later sanctions hearings, that his overall credibility as a
competent, believable advocate suffered greatly. Moreover,
the nature of the conduct underlying the sanctions analysis
—Radbil's questionable trial tactics combined with his
numerous inconsistent excuses for his conduct, which started
during the trial and continued throughout the sanctions
hearings—required a certain amount of repetition by the
Court in its fact findings and, hence, produced this lengthy
opinion. With that backdrop, the Court turns to the facts.
Pre-Trial and Trial Conduct
Pretrial
1. The pretrial discovery phase of this case was marked
by numerous disputes, all of which were overseen and
resolved by Magistrate Judge Jeff Kaplan prior to trial—with
minimal involvement by this Court. Although the pretrial
acrimony was troubling, scant mention was made of the
discovery disputes at the pretrial conference (“PTC”). Instead,
discovery issues were referenced tangentially and only to the
extent that Radbill re-urged certain discovery issues that had
either already been resolved during discovery or should have
been.33 Perplexingly, it was not clear to this Court as the
pretrial conference commenced, which side was responsible
for the inordinately high number of skirmishes and the
mutual discord that pervaded the pretrial phase. Nonetheless,
as the trial progressed, the fog cleared and the Court's
opinion—once informed—shifted dramatically. Specifically,
a disturbing pattern of troubling conduct on Radbil's part
began to emerge, ranging from a defiant, unprofessional
attitude to making outright misrepresentations to the Court
and RAB's counsel.
2. First, as the Court began to interact with Radbil during the
PTC, it noted a few missteps on his part which—at first blush
—appeared those of a new lawyer learning the ropes of trial
practice. For example, RAB's counsel, Robbie Malone, stated
at the pretrial conference (without protest from Radbil) that
he failed to timely return her “ten” calls and “ten” e-mails
over the weekend before trial as she attempted to comply with
this Court's Pretrial Order entered the preceding Friday. The
order had directed the parties to attempt to resolve certain
issues before the pretrial conference. 34 Radbil also made
an untimely attempt to add witnesses to his witness list;
witnesses that he had never timely or properly disclosed to
RAB.35 Moreover, Radbil exhibited considerable confusion
during the pretrial proceedings over how to properly present
his opening statement to the jury.36 And he failed to provide a
copy of his marked exhibits to the Court at anytime during the
trial despite being directed to do so in the Pretrial Order.37 He
continually assured the Court during the trial that he had the
exhibits and would provide them to the Court. He never did.

Trial
Counseling
3. From the Court's vantage point, Radbil's ‘novice-lawyer’
missteps began to appear more purposeful than hapless during
his direct examination of Plaintiff White. Specifically, Radbil
posed a question to Plaintiff about whether he had sought
treatment as a result of RAB's debt collection efforts, asking;
“[a]nd have you sought any counseling or treatment as a
result?”38 RAB immediately objected to Radbil's question as
an attempt to elicit evidence relating to damages that had not
been disclosed during discovery. This prompted the Court to
call a bench conference. 39 At the bench conference, when
asked to respond to RAB's objection, Radbil oddly answered,
that even though he had asked the question, he did not know
what Plaintiff's answer to the question would be.40 Confused,
the Court followed up by asking Radbil: “I'm assuming you
must be looking for something favorable or you wouldn't
have asked it [the question].” 41 To which Radbil curiously
responded: “sure.” 42 The Court then asked Radbil: “[d]o
you think [Plaintiff] ... [is] going to say [that he sought no
counseling]?” to which Radbil responded: “no.”43 The Court
then sustained RAB's objection and resumed the trial.44
*6  Radbil's response to the Court's questions at sidebar
as to why he asked the question regarding counseling of
Plaintiff; stating first that he did not know  what the answer
would be only to agree a few minutes later, under further
questioning by the Court, that he assumed the answer would
be favorable, began the steady erosion of his credibility.
Further, this interaction began the first in a series of internally
inconsistent explanations given by Radbil for his questionable
behavior.
$45,000 Actual Damages—Surprise Testimony
4. Later during the trial, also in connection with Plaintiff's
damages—and contrary to his pretrial stance—Radbill asked
Plaintiff about the present “status” of his loans, which
evoked a response from White stating—for the first time
since the inception of the case—that he had incurred an
additional $40,000  in excess fees due to RAB's refusal
to work with him on a repayment schedule. 45 Also later
during the proceedings, and again contradicting his pretrial
disclosures and his deposition testimony, White testified, on
questioning by Malone, that he lost an additional $5000 when
RAB's activities caused him to have to drop a teaching class.46
When RAB's counsel questioned him on the inconsistency
between his trial testimony and pretrial disclosures, Plaintiff
conceded the contradiction and agreed with RAB's counsel
that he (Plaintiff) had testified in his pretrial deposition that
—at the time of the deposition—he was not aware of any
“current economic damages” or money “out-of-pocket” as a
result of RAB' actions.47
$45,000 Damages Testimony—RAB Objects—Radbil's Three
Conflicting Excuses
5. At the close of the trial proceedings for that day, Malone
complained to the Court about the unexpected $45,000 in
damages testimony, arguing that Radbil had knowingly failed
to disclose the $5000 and $40,000 damages figures to RAB
during discovery, including during White's deposition, or at
any time during the pretrial proceedings and was attempting
to “ambush” RAB at trial. 48 When asked for a response
by the Court, Radbil responded by indicating the figures
had been disclosed: “... in our supplemental disclosures, our
pretrial disclosures, we have amended that. I believe with
respect to the charges that Mr. White incurred, he incurred
those after the deposition.” 49 To this the Court inquired:
“Where are the submissions that give them [RAB] notice
of the amount of damages that you are seeking outside of
the initial response Ms. Malone referred to ? Where are
they [$45,000] disclosed?”50 Radbil responded by providing
three internally inconsistent explanations for his actions. 51
Radbil first insisted again that he had in fact disclosed the
$5000 and $40,000 to RAB “in the pretrial order” and “at
the mediated settlement” conference. But Radbil could not
substantiate this claim in the referenced materials or anywhere
else in the record for that matter. 52 Upon further delving by
the Court, Radbil shifted to a second explanation that the
$5,000 and $40,000 figures were actually not “quantified” in
the pretrial disclosures but insisting that RAB had “been on
notice of a significant amount of [Plaintiff's] actual damage
for a long time.”53 Appearing then to abandon his insistence
that the actual figures had ever been disclosed, Radbil shifted
theories for the third time, expressing dismay that the $5,000
and $40,000 figures even had to be disclosed in their “exact
amount”54 because they were based on Plaintiff's “mental
anguish and emotional distress” and for the jury and not
the Plaintiff to quantify. 55 Radbil never explained how the
$40,000 and $5000 figures, he defended as properly in
evidence, were not quantifiable given that the figures were
derived from testimony by Plaintiff about his actual out-

of-pocket losses—as opposed to abstract emotional/mental
anguish damages—due to RAB's debt collection activities.
From the Court's perspective, Radbil appeared to be‘making
it up as he went along’ in a litany of internally inconsistent
explanations to the Court.
Second Deposition Argument by Radbil
*7  6. Another disturbing event—in keeping with Radbil's
pattern of prevarication and evasiveness—that occurred at
the close of the trial testimony was when Radbil insisted he
needed to recall Robert F. Wyatt, the Director of Compliance
for Human Resources for RAB. Radbil urged the Court to
allow him to recall Wyatt as a “corporate representative” even
though Radbil had already called him to the witness stand and
questioned him at length. Radbil's excuse for recalling Wyatt
was that Wyatt had given insufficient answers at his pretrial
deposition. To support his position that the deposition was
faulty and inadequate, Radbill quoted from that deposition
to the Court. Disconcertingly, a few minutes later, RAB's
counsel pointed out—and Radbil conceded—that Radbil, in
arguing to recall Wyatt, had disingenuously been quoting
from Wyatt's first pretrial deposition. When, in fact, the
magistrate judge on Radbil's motion had permitted Radbil a
second pretrial deposition to re-explore this very topic with
Wyatt who, in preparation, had educated himself on the topic
and had testified for 45 minutes at the second deposition
under questioning by Radbil. 56 Moreover, Radbil had asked
Wyatt the same-type questions in the second deposition that
he sought to ask by recalling Wyatt to the stand on direct
examination at trial—all the while justifying recalling White
by pointing to the inadequacies in the first deposition.57
Warning by the Court
7. At the close of the foregoing discussion, the parties rested.
Radbil's trial missteps coupled with the disturbingly circular
explanations for his conduct prompted a warning from the
Court. The Court admonished Radbil about his tactics, stating
to him:“I am concerned about your conduct in this case....
[W]hat I have seen here is disingenuous behavior ... that
seems to skirt the truth in more that one respect.”58 The Court
then adjourned for the day but instructed the parties to appear
the next day by 8:00 am to finalize the jury instructions and
present their closing arguments to the jury.59
Second Day of Trial—Radbil's No-Show and White's
Admission to the Court in Radbil's Absence That He Had
Quantified his Damages
8. The following day, the Court, RAB's counsel, Malone and
Martin, and Radbil's client, Timothy White, were present in
court at 8:00 am as directed. Radbil, however, was nowhere to
be found; he neither appeared nor called the Court to explain
his absence. By 9:00 am Radbil had still not appeared nor had
he called the Court. At ten minutes after 9:00 am, the Court
convened proceedings in the courtroom and asked Plaintiff if
he had heard anything from the still-absent Radbil. Plaintiff
stated that he had not heard from Radbil and that they had
agreed to meet at 7:00 am that morning. 60 Plaintiff, looking
exasperated, stated he had left several unreturned messages
for Radbil and did not know what was going on.61 The Court
then asked Plaintiff if he would like time to try to reach
Radbil again and decide how to proceed; to which Plaintiff
spontaneously offered:
I can do that. And again, I apologize. I'm embarrassed,
actually mortified, you know, by the circumstances. This
is a huge inconvenience to the Court, and I apologize to
Ms. Malone and Mr. Wyatt. I'm really not aware of what's
going on with Mr. Radbil. I didn't—you know, I didn't dial
a lawyer. I contacted a student loan advice website and
—over a number of months, actually, and was referred to
this law firm. Everything seemed to be square. Everything
seemed to be legitimate. I'm not an attorney, but, you know,
they seemed to know what they were doing, and I'm sorry
that this has happened....62
The discussion on how to proceed without Radbil continued.
And the Court proceeded, as planned, still assuming Radbil
would appear, to grant RAB's Rule 50 motion as to the
TCPA claim which RAB and Radbil had argued the previous
afternoon.63 With jury arguments looming and the Court's
instructions set to be finalized, the Court advised Plaintiff that
he did not have to speak to RAB's counsel about possible
settlement but that it was entirely his choice. White was
advised by the Court to take some time to decide what he
wanted to do.64
Later, still waiting for Radbil, Plaintiff spontaneously offered
a comment as to Radbil's confusing argument the previous
day when he attempted to justify his non-disclosure of the
$45,000 in damages to the Court with three conflicting
excuses. White stated:

## Page 7

 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 7
*8  ... I apologize, it seems presumptuous for me—seems
like I'm acting like my own attorney, which I am not in
any way. But I felt like I should make a response to the
issue of sandbagging [by Radbil] yesterday with the claims.
I did quantify the damages. And they were not an abstract
sum for mental anguish [as urged by Radbil], they were real
financial damages that I suffered. I made sure Mr. Radbil
had that information. The [magistrate judge] ... recorded
it in the settlement conference, and I was led to believe it
would be submitted for this trial, which of course it wasn't.
So I apologize.”65
Radbil Appears Two Hours Late for Trial
9. The Court then adjourned briefly to allow Plaintiff and
RAB to discuss possible settlement as indications were that
Radbil had abandoned his client. The Court recessed at 9:15
am until 10:15 at which time Radbil appeared in court. 66 He
explained that he had suffered food poisoning that morning
but did not contact anyone because “there was nobody that
[he] could call.” 67 From the Court's viewpoint, Radbil's
appearance and demeanor that morning did not comport with
his story that he had been—just an hour or so earlier—so
stricken with food poisoning that he was unable to contact the
Court or his client.
After Radbill arrived, White indicated to the Court that—in
Radbill's absence—he had tentatively reached an agreement
with RAB. 68 RAB's counsel recited the terms of the
settlement on the record. Radbil, having none of it, insisted
on counseling his client.69 After talking to Radbil in private,
White stated he wished to continue with Radbil as his
lawyer.70 The Court adjourned as the parties agreed to discuss
settlement which apparently involved nothing more that
Radbil accusing RAB's counsel of misconduct in talking to his
client. In short, Radbil refused go forward with the settlement
agreement that Plaintiff had agreed to in his absence and
instead accused RAB's counsel of threatening White.71
More Warnings by the Court
The Court warned Radbil:
... Mr. Radbil, your behavior has been shocking. And I
have found it driven as we go through this by bad faith
and dishonest behavior. You didn't show up for trial this
morning after your poor, substandard behavior yesterday;
no word from you. As I said, I have no glimmer of belief
that you were sick, ... [Y]ou have shown up and you look
fine, and no one heard from you for two hours, including
your client. So don't you dare accuse defense counsel
of anything, when you brought on all of the chaos this
morning that caused the Court to ask, in my obligation, to
make sure things are being ethically conducted, to ask your
client if he heard from you, and, if not, what his position
was on this case. As far as I knew, you abandoned the
case.... We will take care, Mr. Radbil, of your conduct after
this case is over, and it will be serious.72
10. Next, the parties presented their jury arguments, the Court
read the jury instructions and the jury retired to deliberate at
4:25 pm on February 27, 2013 and then adjourned for the
day at 5:00 pm.73 The jury returned the next day at 8:30 am.
By 9:15 am they returned a verdict in favor of RAB on all
claims against them. As to those claims on which Plaintiff had
prevailed on summary judgment, the jury found that Plaintiff
should receive “$0” damages.74
*9  Before adjourning the trial, the Court notified Radbil:
Mr. Radbil, we will have a full sanctions hearing, not
only about your conduct and misrepresenting facts to the
Court over and over in this case and then falsely accusing
counsel, which are two of the most serious offenses that
you can make as before a tribunal, but also I am really
concerned that you are not capable or competent to be
representing clients in federal court. And so the hearing will
also bear upon your qualifications and whether or not you
should be prohibited from practicing in federal court based
upon the incompetence and, more importantly than that, the
dishonesty that you have displayed throughout this case.75
11. To sum up, Radbil's conduct at the pretrial and trial,
from the Court's first-hand observation, appeared to be
that of an arrogant, yet surprisingly short-on-experience
and unprepared representative for his client. He displayed
a woefully inadequate understanding of basic pretrial
procedures on such issues as timely designating witnesses,
the components of a proper opening statements and even the
need to provide marked exhibits to the Court and co-counsel.
More importantly, during trial, he elicited testimony (about
actual damages and counseling efforts from his client) that he
had never disclosed to RAB despite RAB's proper discovery
requests for the information. This unexpected testimony was
highly disconcerting to RAB, having gone to extensive efforts
to prepare for trial based on the discovery and disclosures it
received from Radbil.

By far the most egregious and disappointing aspect of Radbil's
trial conduct was his willingness to mislead the Court and
counsel. Indeed, as will be addressed in more detail in
the next sections, replete throughout the record, is example
after example of Radbil's seemingly ingrained practice of
prevarication and misrepresentation. It was this practice
that tainted the entire trial and obstructed the truth-seeking
function of the Court.
As mentioned above, RAB filed its sanctions motions shortly
after trial. A hearing on the motions was convened on August
2, 2013.
Sanctions Hearings
August 2, 2013 Hearing
12. At the August 2, 2013 hearing on the sanctions motions,
attorneys Malone and Martin appeared on behalf of RAB.
Noah Radbil was represented by Marshall Meyers, a partner
in the Weisburg firm. Meyers also appeared on behalf of the
Weisburg firm.76
13. Malone, in her opening statement explained that her
motions for sanctions were based, inter alia , on Radbil's
misrepresentations and attempted “sandbagging” of RAB
during trial with the previously undisclosed $5000 and
$40,000 in damages.77 She further stated that she was basing
her request for sanctions on Radbil's deception to RAB
and the Court regarding Plaintiff' counseling efforts. 78 She
argued that Radbil's overall refusal to cooperate during the
entirety of the proceedings caused RAB multiple extra hours
of work. 79 These extra efforts, she maintained, included
attempting to prepare and defend a case in which they were
lied to, given incomplete and/or incorrect information and
were forced to review numerous documents. All of this,
Malone complains, was required to establish to the Court that
numerous representations by Radbil to the Court and counsel
were flatly contradicted by the record.80 As a side note, much
of the complained-of conduct occurred in the Court's presence
or was evident to the Court by virtue of Radbil's behavior
during the proceedings.
*10  14. Meyers spoke next. Much to the Court's dismay, he
adopted an unexpectedly defiant tone, most of which failed
to address the accusations in RAB's sanctions motions or
Malone's argument. Instead, Meyers touted his confidence
in his and his firm's integrity. He refused to concede that
Radbil engaged in any misconduct—save failing to appear
in court on the day of jury argument. In short, by refusing
to acknowledge the undeniable shortcomings in Radbil's
representation of Plaintiff, he lost credibility with the Court
as soon as he began speaking and things only got worse from
there. In short, Meyers adopted the same evasive refusal to
answer direct questions or concede facts that were clearly
established by the record that characterized Radbil's approach
to the case. A sampling from Meyers' opening comments:
It's exceptionally difficult, Judge, to sit and listen to
what Ms. Malone said. I am here, Your Honor, to take
responsibility for anything that my firm did, and Mr. Radbil
is part of my firm. Ms. Malone certainly uses a lot of words,
but I see them, Your Honor , as really naked allegations.
There are clearly some things—and obviously Mr. Radbil
being late to trial, there is no excuse for that, there is no
response to that, and we deserve whatever penalty the Court
imposes. To suggest that Mr. Radbil is a liar really hurts
me, Your Honor, because I know Noah and have worked
with him for a long time. I'm here to listen, like the Court
is, to the evidence and see if I'm mistaken. But everything
I know about Noah runs contradictory to what Ms. Malone
says. When we talk about the Rule 37 motion, Your Honor,
I think we laid out in our response point by point to every
allegation that Ms. Malone made how she was mistaken as
to what occurred. And I believe in the 1927 motion we did
the same, Your ... But I've obviously got to touch on some
of these issues to show the difference between us being
wrong as a matter of fact or law in the Court's view versus
us engaging in behavior that deserves sanctions. And I can't
talk about one without crossing into the other, but I want to
be clear. I'm not asking the Court to reconsider anything.81
...
It is obviously imperative to me as a person, not as a lawyer
but as a person, that I do things the right way and my firm
does things the right way. And to suggest I am manipulating
consumers is really a very tough pill to swallow.82
...
I'm here, Your Honor, to—to learn from the Court what
we could have done differently, what we could have done
better. And I'm here to explain, Your Honor, that no matter
how it is casted,(sic) it is not who I am as a lawyer, as a
business person, as a human being, to be the terrible person
that Ms. Malone makes me out to be. I am very selective
in the cases I bring and in the clients I accept, Your Honor.

And certainly it's the practice of law, and I've got to get
better at it, and I believe that I will get better every day
until I obviously stop working, Your Honor. But at the end
of the day, Your Honor, I think—I would—very clear on
being late to trial, no question, sanctions. A little less clear
on what exactly it was that we did during the case that is
worthy of sanctions.  And I would like obviously to hear
specifically and be able to present the Court evidence.83
15. Toward the close of Meyers' opening remarks, the Court
asked Meyers whether, in preparing for the hearing, he had
spoken to Plaintiff White about the allegations by RAB
against Radbil. Meyers responded; “... I have not [spoken
to White].” The Court, taken aback that Meyers had not
approached his firm's client under the circumstances, then
inquired: “So you've got ... these motions for sanctions, you've
got a highly unusual situation with one of your attorneys ...,
and you haven't talked to the client about what happened?”84
Meyers responded:
*11  You know, I haven't, Your Honor. I haven't. And it
was a decision that I did not want to bring up anything to Dr.
White that would, you know, rehash anything that was bad
that occurred, Your Honor. And because I was not there, I
really didn't want to get a skewed vision of what happened.
I wanted my understanding to be based on the transcript,
itself, because that would seem to be the strongest indicator
of what happened.85
Meyers then stated that “this has been a very difficult, difficult
thing for me to get my head around.” 86 Shortly after this
discussion, the testimony began with Malone calling Radbil
as her first witness.
Radbil's Testimony
16. Rather than recount Radbil's lengthy sanctions hearing
testimony in full, the Court will review the key points. 87
First, as an overview, Radbill's testimony at the hearing was
fraught with the same defiant, frustratingly obtuse manner
of answering questions that mirrored his approach at trial. 88
As will be seen below, Radbil's description of many events
was illogical and in many respects contradicted by the record
including by his own prior statements. It also required the
Court, on countless occasions, to call on RAB to research
its records, the court records and the transcripts in order to
respond to Radbil's numerous conflicting statements about
what had occurred in the case.
17. Radbill testified that he graduated from law school in 2009
and resides in Arizona.89 He testified (in a later hearing) that
in July 2012, after approximately 18 months of practice, he
was counsel of record in approximately 100 cases.90
18. Although Radbil claimed at the time of his testimony that
he had an actual—as opposed to ‘virtual’—office in Texas, his
official office address, at the time of the hearing, listed with
the State Bar of Texas is a post office box. Radbil denied this,
claiming to have updated the address, but when confronted
with the State Bar website information by RAB's, counsel, he
conceded the issue.91
Radbil Suspended from Practice
19. Radbil had been suspended from the practice of law during
a portion of the pendency of this case for failing to pay his
dues to the State Bar of Texas. Nonetheless, at the hearing, he
refused to admit he had been suspended. The now-standard,
extremely frustrating back and forth with him on this topic
is set out below. 92 Even Meyers, Radbil's lawyer, later told
the Court that Radbil should have admitted to the suspension
question.93
*12  20. Radbil was also asked about several incidents
that RAB considered misconduct on his part. One of those
issues was whether his firm had ever conveyed a reasonable
settlement demand to RAB. 94 After a frustratingly circular
response, Radbil finally admitted that the only post-filing
demand he gave RAB was for approximately $100,000.95
Unexpected $45, 000 in Actual Damages Testimony—Two
New Post-Trial Excuses
Background
21. Malone next questioned Radbil about the incident at
trial regarding the testimony by White about his $40,000
and $5000 in damages. As described above and for context
here, in Radbil's September 29, 2012 pretrial disclosures to
RAB, Radbil stated that Plaintiff's damages were limited to
$1500 in actual damages, reserving the right to supplement.96
As also described above, on January 18, 2013, just weeks
before trial, Radbil disclosed that Plaintiff's actual damages
—without citing any monetary figures—included any out-of-
pocket damages as well as damages for public humiliation,
embarrassment, mental anguish and emotional distress. 97
Later, at trial—for the first time, since the inception of

## Page 10

White v. Regional Adjustment Bureau, Inc., Not Reported in Fed. Supp. (2015)
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 10
the case—Plaintiff testified that he had incurred $40,000 in
excess fees due to RAB's refusal to work with him on a
repayment schedule. 98 White also testified that he lost an
additional $5000 due to RAB's activities causing him to
have to drop a teaching class. 99 RAB objected at trial to
the unexpected damages testimony. And, as described above,
after RAB's objected to the testimony, Radbil gave the Court
three different explanations as to how he had fulfilled his
pretrial disclosure obligations as to the damages figures.
First, he said that he had disclosed the damage figures.
Second, he claimed that the damages were disclosed but not
quantified. And, third, Radbil maintained that the $40,000 and
$5000 figures were based on emotional distress and mental
anguish and, therefore, did not need to be reduced to specific
amounts.100
*13  As discussed next, at the August 2, 2013 sanctions
hearing and in his sanctions briefing, Radbil came up with two
new reasons for his failure to disclose the $45,000. Neither of
these new excuses were mentioned by Radbil when the Court
questioned him at trial. Moreover, both of his new excuses
conflicted with his explanations to the Court during trial.101
New (Fourth) Excuse—Actual Damages Were Part of a
Confidential “Privileged” Settlement Memorandum and
Thus Could Not Be Disclosed
22. For context, as mentioned, during trial, RAB accused
Radbil of attempting to ambush it at trial with the $45,000
damages testimony by White. In support of its “ambush”
theory, in its Rule 37  Motion, filed shortly after trial,
RAB argued that Radbil's attorney billing records revealed
that Radbil, the day before pretrial disclosures were due
(December 7, 2012), had reviewed a memorandum from
White to Radbil on the topic of White's actual damages but
that this memorandum had never been disclosed to RAB
in violation of Fed. R. Civ. P. 37 .102 This, RAB argued in
its sanctions briefing, proved that Radbil had intended to
“ambush” RAB at trial with undisclosed damages evidence
provided to Radbil before trial.103
Responding to this allegation, Radbil maintained in his
post-trial sanctions briefing that White's December 6, 2012
actual damages memorandum was received and reviewed by
him but not disclosed to RAB because it was a privileged
document. Nonetheless, Radbil insisted, RAB was well aware
of this privileged memorandum prior to trial—ostensibly,
from Radbil's attorney billing records in RAB's possession
—but that RAB never moved to compel. Radbil justified his
non-disclosure of the information in the memo as follows:
...
... The particular document in question is a memorandum
regarding actual damages that Dr. White's counsel
requested he draft in preparation for trial. See Doc. 119
at 5. Dr. White's counsel was not required to provide Dr.
White's actual damages memorandum to RAB under Fed.
R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(B) because Dr. White's actual damages
memorandum is privileged or protected from disclosure
under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3)(A)(i)-(ii)....
Having been prepared specifically at the request of his
counsel in preparation for trial, Dr. White's memorandum
regarding his actual damages  would not ordinarily be
discoverable absent RAB showing a substantial need for
the materials to prepare its case and an inability, without
undue hardship, to obtain substantially equivalent evidence
by other means. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3)(A)(i)-(ii) .
Dr. White's deposition provided such means. See App. 25
(White Dep. at 29:16-23) (estimating disputed amount of
debt owed to Texas Guaranteed at $40,000).
While Dr. White did not expressly claim that Dr. White's
actual damages memorandum was privileged and protected
as trial-preparation materials under Rule 26(b)(5) , RAB
admittedly received notice of the Dr. White's trial
preparation memorandum prior to trial. Doc. 119 at 5.
Having filed two prior motions to compel discovery ... one
denied as moot and the other on its merits, see sections I and
II, supra, RAB took no action to compel the memorandum's
production. Therefore, RAB necessarily failed to show any
substantial need for the memorandum or that it could not
obtain substantially equivalent evidence through its client,
Texas Guaranteed.104
*14  In other words, Radbil urges in his sanctions
briefing, that on December 6, 2012, he (Radbil) received a
“confidential” memorandum from White regarding White's
actual damages, which Radbil claims RAB was aware of
but, nonetheless, failed to move to compel, thus depriving
itself of the ability to view its contents. Thus according to
Radbil, it was RAB's own fault for not getting the information
Radbil possessed regarding White's actual damages that RAB
claimed it was entitled to. Radbil repeated this theory at the
sanctions hearing on August 2, 2013.105

## Page 11

But this made little sense under the circumstances. Despite
being inconsistent with his plethora of other excuses for
permitting the $40,000 and $5000 damage testimony by
White, Radbil wholly fails to explain how RAB had a
duty or even the ability to glean from Radbil's cryptically
worded billing statements106 that they contained White's hard
damages figures. Moreover, Radbil fails to address how or
why RAB would even suspect that it needed to move to
compel this memorandum from the billing statements when
all indications from Radbil to RAB during the entirety of
formal discovery and pretrial phases of the case were that
White had no more than $1500 in actual damages.107
The Fifth Excuse for the $45,000 Undisclosed Damage
Testimony at Trial—“Rogue Response” by White.
23. Further undermining Radbil's steadily faltering credibility
was, again, during the August 2, 2013 hearing when he came
up with yet a fifth theory for not turning over the $45,000
figure to RAB. Specifically, Radbil, during his August 6,
2013 testimony, for the first time since White's trial testimony,
stated (in response to a question by Meyers), that the $40,000
and $5000 damages figures came out as a complete surprise
to Radbil, a sort of “rogue” response by White.108
But, this newly added “rogue client” theory was as dubious as
the others for several reasons. For one, Radbil had vigorously
defended the admission of the $45,000 during trial. Even
when he stated that the $45,000 constituted unquantifiable
mental anguish damages, never did he say at trial that the
$40,000 and $5000 figures did not belong in the case or were
erroneously interjected into the case by him or by a “rogue”
client. And not once did Radbil allude to this “rogue client”
theory in his sanctions briefing.
Undisclosed Counseling Efforts
24. Next, Malone questioned Radbil regarding RAB's
contention that Radbil tried to offer undisclosed testimony
about Plaintiff's efforts to undergo counseling. 109 As
recounted above, during the trial, Radbil asked Plaintiff
whether he had sought counseling due to RAB's debt
collection activities, RAB objected, prompting the Court to
call a side-bar conference. At the side-bar conference, Radbil
strangely told the Court that he did not know what Plaintiff's
response to the counseling question would be. 110 And then,
after a question by the Court, Radbil said he assumed the
answer would be favorable.
At the sanctions hearing, however, Radbil did an about-
face, now insisting that Plaintiff had sought counseling
prior to trial. 111 Radbil also maintained—in his responsive
briefing to the sanctions motions—that Plaintiff had disclosed
both in his interrogatory responses and in “extensive”
deposition testimony that he had received counseling.112 But,
as explained in RAB's Reply to Radbil's Response to RAB's
Rule 37  Motion, none of this is true. As described below,
nothing in the record supports Radbil's assertion that Plaintiff
either sought counseling or disclosed any counseling efforts
before trial.
*15  In its Reply and at the sanctions hearing on the
counseling issue, RAB points to pretrial deposition questions
by its counsel asking White whether he undertook any
counseling efforts (resulting from RAB's debt collection
activities). White answered that he had not talked to
his doctor or any other healthcare provider about RAB's
debt collection activity. 113 RAB further points to White's
deposition testimony that he had never discussed his panic
attacks with any healthcare provider other than Dr. Cush,
his rheumatologist. 114 RAB also notes that White testified
at his deposition that he had not sought counseling from Dr.
Cush or any other psychologist or psychiatrist.115 As further
evidence that Radbil had not disclosed White's counseling
efforts prior to trial, RAB refers to an interrogatory asking
White the following question:
INTERROGATORY NO. 23: If you likely will require
medical and/or psychiatric treatment in the future with
respect to the symptoms of stress and/or mental anguish
alleged in Plaintiff's Original Petition, state the name and
address of each person who has advised you that you will
likely require medical and/or psychiatric treatment in the
future, the treatment you will likely receive, the date such
treatment will likely be received, and the cost of such future
medical and/or psychiatric treatment.
To which White answered:
ANSWER: None. Plaintiff hereby expressly reserves the
right to supplement this response throughout the continuing
course of discovery
In the face of this undeniable evidence, Radbil's assertions
that White sought counseling and that it was, therefore, an
appropriate area of inquiry at trial is flatly false.
Undisclosed Witnesses

## Page 12

25. Next up at the August 2, 2013 hearing was the
topic of RAB's complaint about Radbil's attempt to offer
undisclosed witnesses at trial. 116 Specifically, on December
7, 2012, Radbil supplemented his pretrial disclosures with
nine previously undisclosed witnesses. 117 On January 18,
2013, a few weeks before trial, Radbil again supplemented
his pretrial disclosures with additional witnesses, five of
whom had not previously been disclosed, four of those
who appeared to be expert witnesses.118 Radbil had not
designated expert witnesses at anytime earlier in the case.
That Radbil might be attempting to add undisclosed experts
in the case at the eleventh hour, prompted RAB to prepare
and file motions to strike.119 Then, as set forth above, Radbil
filed two contradictory responses to RAB's motions to strike
the undisclosed experts. In his first response, Radbil denied
that any experts would testify. Later, on the heels of denying
experts would testify, he filed another document with the
Court, stating that, in fact, “one” of his witnesses would
provide expert testimony.120
After the trial, in response to RAB's Rule 37  Motion for
Sanctions regarding this issue, Radbil stated that he never
intended to offer expert testimony and that the expert dispute
had been resolved by the parties at the PTC and essentially
was a dead issue.121 Yet, he fails in his sanctions briefing to
address the inconsistency in his responses to the motions to
strike. That is, until the August 2, 2013 sanctions hearing,
where Radbil—for the first time—offered a new explanation
for his inconsistent responses; that being that the statement
that “one” of his witnesses would provide expert testimony,
was simply a typo that should have said “ none” instead of
“one.”122 This new version of events is questionable for
several reasons, not the least of which is Radbil's own billing
records, dated September 21, 2012, indicating that Radbil
notified his “expert” of the trial date.123 Specifically, Malone
asked Radbil about one of his billing records with the entry
“... prepare letter to expert re[:] date for trial....”124
*16  The fact that no experts were ultimately called by Radbil
at trial is of no moment to the sanctions analysis, because the
point of recounting this incident is that it provides yet another
in a mounting series of incidents demonstrating Radbil's
substandard lawyering in this case and, more importantly,
his persistent pattern of ‘moving target’ explanations for his
litigation tactics.
Plaintiff's No Show for the Verdict
26. Another point raised at the August 2, 2013 sanctions
hearing involved Plaintiff's failing to appear for the return
of the verdict at trial.125 Specifically, when the jury returned
their verdict on February 28, 2013, Plaintiff was not present.
When asked by the Court where he was, Radbil stated that he
was not there because he had to work. 126 Radbil then stated
“I let him know as soon as the verdict was in, and he was
going to head over here as soon as he could.” 127 The Court
directed Radbil to tell White that he was to appear in court
immediately.128 When Plaintiff arrived, he told the Court, “I
was advised by my attorney that I didn't have to be here.”129
The following conversation between the Court, Radbil and
Plaintiff ensued:
MR. RADBIL: ... Mr. White, didn't I advise you that you
should be here when the verdict came back?
DR. WHITE: You advised me that I did not need to be here;
it was not necessary.
MR. RADBIL: And did I advise you that you should be
here when the verdict came back this morning when we—
THE COURT: Just be honest, Dr. White.
DR. WHITE: A few minutes ago, yes.
THE COURT: But not before a few minutes ago.
DR. WHITE: Right.
THE COURT: Thank you. Mr. Radbil, once again I have
caught you in a less than candid assertion to the Court. But
we can take all that up when we have the hearing that we're
going to have regarding your behavior in this case at a later
time. Dr. White, you are free to go. Thank you.130
At a later hearing, Radbil produced an e-mail exchange
between himself and White, purportedly at the time
the verdict was returned—albeit, reflecting an hour's
difference in time from the time the actual verdict was
returned.131 The e-mail contains an exchange between
Radbill and White the morning the verdict was returned
showing Radbil telling White to come to court when the
verdict was returned.132 That said, the introduction of this
exhibit does not clarify why, in the presence of the Court the
morning of the verdict, White and Radbil gave conflicting

## Page 13

White v. Regional Adjustment Bureau, Inc., Not Reported in Fed. Supp. (2015)
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 13
accounts of why White was not present in court for the
verdict.
More Warnings to Radbil
27. At the close of the August 2, 2013 (full day) sanctions
hearing, the Court made the following statement to the parties:
THE COURT: (Speaking to Radbil) ... [My] concern is that
I'm not seeing any indication from you today, other than
the fact that you were late to court, that you did anything
wrong. Is that what your position is, that you are right and
they are just nitpicking?
RADBIL: No, Your Honor. My position is that I didn't do
anything—
THE COURT: Speak up, please.
THE WITNESS: My position is that nothing was done in
bad faith; nothing was done intentionally or vexatiously....
...
THE COURT: What I am seeing is an overwhelming record
of misrepresentations and misconduct and not being honest
with the Court about one thing after another after another....
And what at least I was hoping to hear from you today was
that you recognized that and are sorry, and I don't see that.
And I [also] don't see that from you, Mr. Meyers, except
for a little bit more of a concession that his behavior was
unacceptable....133
*17  ...
I would like to move ahead and see whatever else we have. I
would like to hear a little bit more specific on the attorney's
fees and the nexus or causation therefore, the conduct and
the attorney's fees. But otherwise, you can step down, Mr.
Radbil, going to move ahead....134
After some discussion with the lawyers the Court concluded
the proceedings for the day and scheduled a second
hearing for the following week, August 7, 2013. Before
adjourning, the Court notified Meyers of his potential
personal responsibility for bad faith conduct, stating:
THE COURT: Here is what my thoughts are at this point....
This is a very, very serious type of hearing, conduct that is
completely unacceptable not only professionally towards
opposing counsel.... [T]he Court had [a] firsthand view of
the anguish that this behavior caused the client when he was
left here for two hours with no word from counsel. We need
to finish this. And we need to make sure that the record
is clear before the ultimate decision and responsibility
is determined.... [W]ith ... [Malone's] position that Mr.
Meyers should be called to testify for his responsibility
and that of the firm, I think that may be appropriate, but I
don't think it's appropriate today because, as far as I know,
he hasn't been placed on notice that he might be subject
to that kind of sanction. And when you are talking about
potential bad faith conduct—and I want to be sure I'm clear,
the Court is also going to rely here on its inherent authority
—then I think Mr. Meyers needs to have a chance to find
counsel and speak on his own behalf and on behalf of his
firm.135
The case was adjourned until August 7, 2013.
August 7, 2013 Sanctions Hearing
28. Instead of proceeding on August 7, 2013, Meyers moved
to continue the sanctions hearing for 30 days, his filing
accompanied by numerous documents not previously noticed
as exhibits.136
The Court rejected Meyer's attempt to offer the new
documents at that time but granted his motion for continuance
to further prepare and organize his new exhibits, given
Malone's intent to call him as a witness. 137 An Order was
entered resetting the hearing for October 9, 2013 and directing
the parties to prepare and exchange exhibits they planned to
offer that were not already part of the record.138
October 9, 2013 Sanctions Hearing
29. At the October 9, 2013 hearing, Malone and Martin
appeared again for RAB. Meyers appeared on his own behalf
and on behalf of the Weisberg firm. New to the case, attorneys
Dale Jefferson and Raul Suazo made their first appearance
on behalf of Radbil. The Court commenced the hearing by
clarifying the record as to the admitted exhibits. 139 The
testimony then began with Malone calling Meyers to the
witness stand.
*18  30. The thrust of Malone's questioning of Meyers was
to establish—and she did—that, although Meyers and other
members of the Weisburg firm were aware of a litany of
ethical and tactical missteps by Radbil in the course of his
work as an attorney for their law firm, they nonetheless
publicly promoted him as a key member of their firm for

the state of Texas. 140 For example, Meyers admitted that
the firm's website—up until a few weeks before the October
9th hearing—listed Radbil as their “managing attorney” for
Texas.141 This, despite the fact that Meyers—as he testified—
had never seen Radbil perform in a formal hearing or trial and
Meyers' concession at the sanctions hearing that he was not
sure that he would recommend Radbil's services to others.142
31. Malone also asked Meyers about a case, of which Meyers
was well aware and in which Meyers had some first-hand
involvement. The case was pending (at that time) in the
Southern District of Texas and was styled Scarlott v. Nissan
North America, Inc., et al. , No. 4:10-CV-4865, in which
defendant Nissan North America, Inc (“Nissan”) sought
sanctions against plaintiff's counsel, Noah Radbill,143 Aaron
Radbil, and Dennis Kurz. 144 Nissan's thirty-page motion
for sanctions, filed October 31, 2011, accused the three
attorneys of violating Rule 11 Fed. R. Civ. P . as well as
transgressing numerous ethical codes, including the Texas
Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct and the Texas
Lawyer's Creed.145 Reduced to its essence, the crux of the
conduct complained of by Nissan was that Noah Radbil and
co-counsel lied in their pleadings numerous times to sustain
an untenable legal case against Nissan. 146 The presiding
judge, in his order granting the defendants' motions for
summary judgment entered on August 28, 2013, directed
that the Plaintiff “take nothing” from Nissan “because her
claims are not supported by facts or law.” 147 The court then
invited the prevailing defendants to “request fees, sanctions,
or both.”148
On September 27, 2013, Nissan filed an amended motion
for sanctions. 149 A hearing was held on Nissan's and its
co-defendant's motions for sanctions on October 10, 2013.
The transcript of the hearing shows that the district court
spent the bulk of the hearing chastising Noah Radbil for his
“abysmal judgment and performance” in the case. 150 The
court granted Nissan's sanctions motions, ordering $195,000
be paid by Radbil and his firm to Nissan, specifically calling
out Radbil and his firm for their “unconscionable”151 conduct
in pursuing Nissan in the case and describing Noah Radbil
and his firm as “unprincipled.”152
*19  32. Malone also questioned Meyers about an in-
court filing by Radbil in an unrelated case which Malone
suggested showed that Radbil lacked a basic understanding of
fundamental jury selection principles. Specifically, in 2011,
Radbil had filed a motion for new trial in the 48 th Judicial
District Court for Tarrant County, Texas. In his motion, Radbil
argued that the state trial court had erred in allowing the
attorneys to move to strike certain venire panel members for
cause before permitting them to exercise their peremptory
strikes.153 When confronted with this tactical misstep by
Radbil during the sanctions hearing, after a frustrating attempt
to get a straight answer from him, Meyers conceded Radbil's
error.154
33. Malone also asked Meyers about other incidents of
troubling conduct by Radbil in particular as well as by other
partners in the Weisburg firm in unrelated cases. 155 She
produced numerous exhibits, including motions, orders and
judgments from various cases suggesting that Radbil and/or
the Weisburg firm had been involved in questionable conduct
in other cases.156
*20  34. Malone referred Meyers to an order issued April
26, 2011 by a federal judge in the Southern District of Texas
describing Noah Radbil, who was plaintiff's counsel in the
case, of “petty gamesmanship” for making a “disingenuous
technical argument” that the defendant had improperly served
its Rule 68 offer of judgment on plaintiff in the case by
facsimile and email.157 The court further warned Radbil that
the court would “not permit” such tactics in the future. 158
Meyers acknowledged the order and its contents. 159 Meyers
also did not dispute that after this admonishment for “petty
gamesmanship,” Radbil repeated the identical argument
against RAB in a case pending in the Northern District of
Texas.160
35. Malone also established that Radbil, along with two other
attorneys, was the subject of a show cause order in 2011
by a federal judge in the Western District of Washington
for making “misrepresentations” to that court regarding his
eligibility to practice law in that court.161
36. Malone also asked Meyers about the Weisburg law firm's
public website which, at least up until a week before the
October 9th sanctions hearing, contained false and misleading
information about Radbil and other members of the firm. 162
Among numerous misstatements about Radbil, conceded by
Meyers, contained on the firm's website, was an entry under
“Notable Trial Victories” indicating that Radbil had secured

a victory for a plaintiff named Shannon Whaley, in a 2012
Dallas County debt collection action. 163 In fact, as Meyers
conceded at the hearing, and as the final judgment in the case
reflects, Radbil lost that case when the jury returned a verdict
of $92,000 against his client. 164 Meyers also conceded that
the firm sent out a false press release indicating that Radbil
had won the Whaley case.165
37. Another of several questionable postings on the firm's
website, which was sponsored and controlled by Meyers
and called “Attorneys for Consumers,” 166 hailed Radbil as
counsel in “the first RIAA music-downloading case to go
to trial in the United States.” 167 In fact as Malone pointed
out, the actual court website for that entry shows the case
going to trial two years before Radbil was even licensed as
an attorney.168 Meyers indicated that he knew “nothing about
that case” but conceded that he had, nonetheless, permitted
it on the firm website without checking the validity of the
posting.169 The website also notes that Radbil represented
“several authors” in a copyright-infringement case against
“Scribd,” which, according to Malone and not disputed by
Meyers, also concluded before Radbil was licenced. 170 The
website lists Radbill as being among a group of lawyers
representing a group of NCAA athletes in a class-action
against the NCAA when, in fact, the official court record does
not even list Radbil as counsel of record.171 Radbil made no
attempt at the hearing to refute Malone's challenges to the
questionable website postings about his experience.172
*21  38. Malone also questioned Meyers about several
instances where members of his firm—other than Radbil—
had been sanctioned by courts for misconduct. 173 Meyers
did not dispute that these incidents had occurred, despite
the fact that prior to the October 9, 2013 hearing, he filed
a sworn affidavit with the Court swearing under oath that
“no attorney in his firm ha[d] ... ever been disciplined.” 174
Those sanctions included a 2011 order by a federal judge in
Colorado against Meyers' partner at the time, Craig Erlich,
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1927 for “proceeding to trial without
plausible evidence to support the claim made.”175 That ruling
was affirmed by the Tenth Circuit.176
39. Another sanctions order, this one in 2011, was entered
against founding partner, Alex D. Weisburg and the Weisburg
firm by a Florida state court for filing “baseless” grievances
against four attorneys involved in a case in that court.177 The
Florida court found Weisburg's conduct to be “unjustified,
vicious, willful and malicious.” 178 In another case out of
federal court in Florida in 2013, again involving founding
partner, Alex D. Weisburg, who was also directly involved in
the instant case, the court sanctioned Weisburg under § 1927
for “knowingly and recklessly pursu[ing] claims ... which
clearly would have been foreclosed.”179
40. Meyers himself was the subject of scorn by a federal judge
in the Eastern District of New York who noted the court's
“serious concern” that the lawsuit filed by Meyers, pending
in his court was “an attempt by plaintiff and/or his attorneys
to manipulate the law for an improper purpose.”180 Although
the firm was not ultimately sanctioned, that judge also noted
“other circumstantial evidence suggesting bad faith” and
raised his concern that “plaintiff is a repeat filer of FDCPA
lawsuits, and he is represented by the same attorneys in those
lawsuits.”181 The court also questioned whether plaintiff's
attorneys in that case had acted in “good faith” in advancing
their arguments.182
41. After Malone finished her questioning of Meyers, Meyers,
testifying on his own behalf, launched into a redundant,
platitude-filled defense of his law firm, which for the most
part did not relate to the specifics alleged against the firm
in this case or to the foregoing instances of misconduct by
Radbil and the firm in other cases. 183 When pressed by
the Court, Meyers insisted that he had “never received a
complaint about Noah [Radbil] from opposing counsel.” 184
This statement, however, was directly contradicted by,
inter alia , Nissan's 2011 and 2013 motions for sanctions,
addressed above and pending at the time Meyers made this
statement185 accusing Radbil of numerous, serious ethical
transgressions. Moreover, at the time of his statement to
this Court, Meyers(although he did not disclose it to the
Court) was scheduled to appear the next day—with Radbil—
in the Houston federal court presiding over Nissan's sanctions
motions.186
*22  42. Meyers also told the Court at the October 9, 2013
hearing that he and Radbil no longer worked together even
though, as mentioned, Meyers was scheduled to, and did,
appear with Radbil the day after the October 9th hearing at the
Houston federal court sanctions hearing.187 When questioned
at the subsequent November 6, 2013 sanctions hearing about
his presence at the Houston federal court sanctions hearing,
Meyers conceded that he had appeared at the hearing with

## Page 16

White v. Regional Adjustment Bureau, Inc., Not Reported in Fed. Supp. (2015)
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 16
Radbil on October 9, 2013, but for some reason insisted that
Noah Radbil did not take the lead in defending the sanctions
motion.188 Meyers stated that, not only did Noah Radbil not
take the lead in the sanctions hearing for the firm, Radbil only
spoke at the request of the judge who, according to Meyers,
entreated at one point: “I want to hear from Noah Radbil.”189
But Meyers' description of what happened at the Houston
federal court hearing is not supported by the transcript of
the hearing. The transcript unmistakably shows Noah Radbil
firmly taking the lead at the hearing. The transcript showing
him speaking—not at the judge's request, but on his own
initiative—as the primary, if not sole, advocate for the firm as
reflected on pages 19 through 93 of the 94-page transcript.190
Although Meyers had insisted that Radbil did not take the
lead at the Houston hearing, when asked by this Court about
the specifics of the accusations against Radbil at the Houston
hearing, Meyers professed a lack of memory stating to the
Court that he did not remember the specifics of the allegations
against Radbil by Nissan.191
43. To sum up, the foregoing litany of questionable incidents
involving Radbil, Meyers and other members of their firm
presented by RAB constituted credible evidence in this
Court's view of a firm with no ethical oversight, run
amok. First, Radbil and Meyers mounted negligible, if
any, opposition to the evidence of Radbil's and the firm's
ethical run-ins with other courts or to the evidence of
the dubious website postings about Radbil's experience as
a lawyer for the NCAA, a major league baseball player
and the like. When Meyers did speak up to describe the
Houston federal court sanctions hearing at the November
6, 2013 hearing, his rendition of Radbil's role was flatly
wrong based on the record. Ultimately, the credible proof at
the October 9, 2013 sanctions hearing, established Radbil's
and the firm's willingness—if not propensity—to engage in
questionable litigation tactics. Not only that, the evidence
demonstrated both Radbil's and Meyers' willingness to
fabricate information about Radbil's and the firm's litigation
experience as posted on the firm's public website. Finally,
and most importantly, Meyers' refusal to concede Radbil's
undeniably substandard practices at trial coupled with the fact
that Meyers, himself, employed an almost identical pattern of
evasion and prevarication in the sanctions hearings, doomed
Meyers' and Radbil's credibility and strongly implicated
Meyers' complicity in Radbil's bad faith conduct.
44. The presentation of the evidence was not completed at
the close of the October 9, 2013, sanctions hearing. Radbil's
attorney represented to the Court that he intended to recall
Radbil to the witness stand and Malone indicated that she,
likewise, had additional evidence to present. 192 Thus a third
full sanctions hearing was scheduled for November 6, 2013.
November 6, 2013 Sanctions Hearing
More False Public Website Postings
45. Malone's first witness called at the third full hearing
on RAB's motions for sanctions was Martin, Malone's co-
counsel in the case. Martin was a credible witness. Martin
testified that he had located a Twitter account belonging to
Meyers that, on July 25, 2013—five months after Radbil
lost White's case—that indicated that the Weisburg firm
had prevailed in White's case and that White was entitled
to significant damages. 193 This information was posted by
Meyers despite the fact that at the time of this posting, July
25, 2013, the jury's verdict in this case, returned in February
2013, and the Court's judgment that followed in March 2013
unequivocally stated that Radbil lost the case and that White
“take nothing by his suit” against RAB.194
$45,000 Damages—Surprise Sworn Declaration from White
in absentia
*23  46. Also at the November 6, 2013 hearing, during
Martin's testimony, Meyers produced—for the first time in
court—an affidavit that purported to be a “Declaration of
Timothy White,” dated October 2, 2013, obtained some seven
months after the trial and just days before the October 9,
2013 sanctions hearing.195 Interestingly, this late-filed entry
into the sanctions exhibit mix, produced by Meyers during
his cross-examination of Martin, 196 was by Meyers' own
admission, partially drafted by Meyers, who then forwarded
it to Radbil and Jefferson. 197 More importantly, there is no
indication from the record that White himself played any
role in contributing to the contents of his own Declaration.
Attached to the Declaration were several e-mails as well as a
letter purportedly written by White to Radbil, dated December
28, 2012, in which White recited a summary of his damages,
none of which contained any of out-of pocket figures. 198
Missing were the $45,000 in out-of-pocket damages that
White had testified about at trial. In his Declaration, and at
odds with his statements to the Court at trial, White averred
that neither Radbil nor Meyers ever counseled or advised

## Page 17

White v. Regional Adjustment Bureau, Inc., Not Reported in Fed. Supp. (2015)
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 17
White to seek specific “out-of-pocket” losses in his testimony
to the jury.199
White's Declaration and attached letter were suspect, to say
the least, given White's absence for the entirety of the five
sanctions hearings200 and considering the fact that much of
the Declaration's contents and those of the attached letter
sharply conflicted with White's trial testimony that he had
incurred $45,000 in economic damages and his insistence
to the Court during trial that he had quantified his damages
for Radbil who told him the figures would be submitted
at trial. 201 Further detracting from the evidentiary value
of the Declaration and its attachments was the statement
of Jefferson, Radbil's attorney, to the Court that “Meyers”
had actually “put together” the “affidavit” for White's
signature.202 Meyer's himself told the Court he prepared
paragraphs 1-5 and 11 of the affidavit and then forwarded it
to Radbil and Jefferson. 203 Jefferson said the affidavit was
later—through Jefferson's office—transmitted to a “mobile
notary service” that, in turn, transported it to White's
home where White purportedly signed the affidavit. 204 In
essence, all of this suggesting that, after the August 2,
2013 sanctions hearing, White agreed to sign a notarized
statement, prepared by the lawyers, that sharply conflicted
with his statements to the Court during the trial and his
testimony to the jury. Moreover, White's December 28, 2012
letter—if true—could have bolstered Radbil's theory that he
never intended to seek out-of-pocket damages; not once was
the letter mentioned or even alluded to by Radbil during
trial, in his Response to the sanctions motions (in which
he addressed White's confidential settlement memorandum
regarding actual damages) or at the August 2, 2013 sanctions
hearing.
Equally curious was that the exhibit appeared at all in the
sanctions proceedings. This, in that the Declaration was
prepared and procured to a large extent by Meyers who
had firmly told the Court at the initial sanctions hearing, on
August 2, 2013, that he had not approached or spoken to
White at all about the problems that occurred during trial
which were now causing Meyers, Radbil and the Weisburg
firm to face potentially devastating sanctions. Specifically,
when asked by the Court if he had spoken to White, his firm's
only client in the case, Meyers said:
*24  You know, I haven't, Your Honor. I haven't [spoken
to White]. And it was a decision that I did not want to bring
up anything to Dr. White that would, you know, rehash
anything that was bad that occurred, Your Honor. And
because I was not there, I really didn't want to get a skewed
vision of what happened. I wanted my understanding to be
based on the transcript, itself, because that would seem to
be the strongest indicator of what happened.205
Apparently Meyers had a change of heart in deciding
not only to contact White but also to draft a portion of
White's Declaration which deviated materially from “the
[trial] transcript itself” which Meyers initially described as the
“strongest indicator of what happened.” Equally questionable
about the “Declaration of Timothy White” is its material
departure from White's statements to the Court during the trial
on the morning that Radbil failed to appear insisting he had
given Radbil “his real financial damages” and was assured by
Radbil the figures would be presented at trial. 206 Whereas,
the about-face in his Declaration averred:
9. At no time ever did Noah Radbil, Marshall Myers or
anyone at Weisburg and Meyers coach me, advise me, or
otherwise tell me to tell the jury a specific dollar figure
for damages. To the contrary, Noah always said leave it
up to the jury alone to arrive at a specific figure for actual
damages....207
Malone Testifies
47. Also at the November 6, 2013 hearing, Malone testified,
called by her co-counsel, Martin. Among other topics, she
testified about her interactions with Radbil and the Weisburg
firm. She described her frustration when Radbil failed to
return her “10 calls and e-mails” the weekend before trial
as directed by the Court. 208 She said her observation of
Radbil in this and other cases she had with him was that
he lacks fundamental knowledge of trial basics. 209 She said
that Radbil lied to this Court during trial and the sanctions
hearings and also lied about prior representations of high
profile clients on his website. 210 She said that in another
case she had with Radbil, she caught him reviewing her
trial notebook after she returned to the courtroom from the
restroom.211 Malone was a highly credible witness.
Radbil Testifies Again: $45,000—Another Version—More
Inconsistencies
48. Radbil testified at the proceedings on November 6,
2013, this time called by his counsel, Raul Suazo. Suazo,
on Radbil's behalf, first argued that it was Malone, not

## Page 18

White v. Regional Adjustment Bureau, Inc., Not Reported in Fed. Supp. (2015)
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 18
Radbil, who prompted the questions about damages. 212 But
this is disingenuous—in that it was Radbil who prompted
the inquiry with the question “what is the current status
of your student loan” to which Malone—surprised by
the unexpected introduction of undisclosed actual damages
evidence—logically followed up later with a question asking
if there was anything else by way of damages that had not
been disclosed, prompting the $5000 figure.213
49. During his November 6, 2013 testimony, Radbil, for the
first time stated that the $45,000 was not “mental anguish”
damages at all but was (all along) simple “economic”
damages which Radbil never intended to seek in the first place
because they were solely attributable to Texas Guaranteed,
not to RAB.214
*25  This latest attempt by Radbil to distance himself from
the undisclosed $45,000 evidence fell flat. First, and most
obvious was that this was yet another in a series of entirely
inconsistent excuses for the $45,000. Second, nowhere in his
statements to the Court during the trial or in his sanctions
briefing or at any other time had Radbil ever mentioned that
the $45.000 was attributable solely to Texas Guaranteed and
thus not sought by him at trial. 215 Radbil and Suazo argued
at the hearing that Radbil and White had discussed the fact
that Texas Guaranteed was solely responsible for the $45,000
in damages and that there were two pretrial memoranda
that supported this position. 216 But this is simply not true
upon examination of these documents. 217 In fact, as will
be addressed below, once the contents of the memorandum
were finally disclosed at the November 26, 2013 hearing,
it was clear that nothing in that memorandum remotely
suggests that White ever attributed the $40,000 solely to
Texas Guaranteed.218
The gist of the November 6, 2013 sanctions hearing was that
it was more of the same sleight-of-hand tactics by Radbil and
Meyers that marked all of the prior hearings. In fact, Meyers'
introduction of the lawyer-generated “Declaration” by White,
who, in absentia, months after the trial, contradicted his own
prior statements to the Court about the nature of his damages,
was suspect to say the least. Then Radbil's latest version
of conflicting explanations for the $45,000 damages snafu
—that it was all along “economic” damages—never sought
from RAB because the damages were caused solely by Texas
Guaranteed theory—was not only not believable, it smacked
of a “shell game”—and a poor one at that—perpetrated on the
Court.
After the close of the November 6, 2013 hearing, the Court
scheduled the fifth and final sanctions hearing on RAB's
motions for November 26, 2013.
November 26, 2013 Sanctions Hearing
50. The fifth and final sanctions hearing began with
a continuation of Radbil's testimony, which essentially
consisted of Radbil re-urging his theory that, he did nothing
wrong but, if he did, his actions were not taken in bad faith
and caused no prejudice to RAB.219
51. On cross-examination by Malone, Radbil testified that he
handled the bulk of the substantive work on White's case.220
He also agreed that his work on the case was reviewed by
Weisburg partners, Weisburg, Meyers, Ehrlich and Aaron
Radbil.221
52. Undoubtedly the most significant portion of the
November 26 th hearing was the seemingly inadvertent
disclosure of the actual contents of the December 6, 2012
“confidential settlement memorandum,” discussed above.
The memo contained White's written assessment of his actual
damages which he sent to Radbil the day before pretrial
disclosures were due. This“privileged” memorandum had
been addressed in the sanctions briefing and at the other
sanctions hearings. Most recently this memo was discussed at
the November 6, 2013 sanctions hearing by Malone when she
complained that, although the December 6, 2012 memo had
been cited by Radbil222 and Suazo as containing information
that supported Radbil's theory that he had not intended to
seek the $45,000 in damages, Radbil had never disclosed its
contents to RAB.223
Specifically, as Malone began to question Radbil about
his December 6, 2012 attorney billing records, 224 asking
him about the heretofore described “confidential” actual
damages memo from White dated December 6, 2012,
Suazo spontaneously offered; “... I have the actual memo
if it will speed it up.” 225 The sudden appearance of the
previously undisclosed memorandum's contents by Radbil's
counsel, from the Court's observation, appeared completely
unexpected by Radbil. In fact, Suazo thereafter attempted to
claim, despite having offered up the document, purportedly
only to establish the veracity of Radbil's billing records,
that the memo remained a privileged document. 226 Suazo

## Page 19

White v. Regional Adjustment Bureau, Inc., Not Reported in Fed. Supp. (2015)
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 19
further maintained that the memo was in most respects
the substantially similar to the December 28, 2012 memo
already in evidence as Radbil's sanctions hearing exhibit
34.227 Malone, who stated she had never seen the memo
before, strongly disputed Suazo's argument that the memo
was privileged or that it was “substantially similar” to
the December 28, 2012 memo. 228 The Court agreed with
Malone and, over Suazo and Radbil's objections, admitted the
December 6, 2012 memo as RAB-S Exh. 45.229
*26  The significance of the contents of the December 6,
2012 memo cannot be overstated. First, it stands in stark
contrast to White's already-questionable “Declaration” and
attached letter 230 dated December 28, 2012, produced by
Meyers at the November 6, 2013 hearing. 231 While that
Declaration and letter strongly indicated that hard figures
were never a viable part of White's and Radbil's pretrial
damages discussions, the December 6, 2012 memo confirms
the opposite, that White—as he insisted to the Court during
trial—did provide hard damages figures to Radbil, the day
before their pretrial disclosures were due to be filed in court.
Moreover, as pointed out by Malone once the contents of the
memo were disclosed,232 she observed that the language used
in White's December 6, 2012 memo to Radbil closely tracks
White's trial testimony about the $45,000 in damages.233 For
example, at trial Radbil specifically asked White: “Did the
fact that Regional Adjustment Bureau continued to call your
Simple Surrogacy employment telephone numbers after you
told them not to cause you to suffer actual damages?” 234
To this question, White responded: “Yes, it caused a domino
effect in my life that caused me to develop mental health
symptoms I had never experienced before. And it literally cost
me by adding exponentially to my debt and with some out-
of-pocket costs.”235 This is precisely the type of information
included in White's December 6, 2012 memo that Radbil, by
his question, solicited from White at trial and later insisted
was unplanned.236
Further, not only is the December 6, 2012 memo not
“substantially similar to White's December 28, 2012 letter,”
as urged by Suazo, it effectively contradicts what White wrote
in that letter and it renders White's purported October 2, 2013
“Declaration,” prepared by the lawyers, bereft of evidentiary
value. For example, the December 6, 2012 memorandum
includes among other hard damages figures, two $20,000
figures and one $5000 figure that White claimed as damages
caused by RAB.237 And, in complete contradiction to Radbil's
testimony at the November 6, 2013 hearing, the December 6,
2012 memo contains nothing to support Radbil's most recent
explanation that the $45,000 was attributable solely to Texas
Guaranteed. In fact at the top of the December 6, 2012 memo,
White states that he is describing his damages “ caused by
Regional Adjustment Bureau.”238
After Radbil's testimony, the evidence on the sanctions
motions was closed and the lawyers, Martin (for RAB),
Meyers (for himself and the firm) and Jefferson (for Radbil)
gave their closing remarks. Jefferson's comments, on behalf
on Radbil, repeated Radbil's theme that his missteps, if
any, were not intentional but “communication quirks by
Radbil.”239
Summary of Factual Findings
To sum up, three overall conclusions can be drawn from the
foregoing fifty-pages of factual findings. First, Radbil, despite
being heavily promoted by his firm as a legal talent, does
not possess the competence or integrity to represent clients
in federal court. Second, Radbil's firm, specifically, partner
Marshall Meyers, knows this, endorses Radbil's conduct and
models it himself. Third, Radbil and Meyers effected a fraud
on the Court through evasion, prevarication and outright
lies, in an attempt to avoid negative legal consequences
against them and their firm due to Radbil's unprofessional trial
conduct.
To understand what went so wrong in this case, it is helpful to
start with a description of what should have happened. Under
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a trial is designed,
beginning with the pretrial discovery process, to be a fair
and predictable exercise by the parties in presenting their
theory of a case to a judge or jury. 240 That means, in turn,
that the parties are entitled to notice of the other side's
evidence through the pretrial discovery process. The pretrial
process allows for broad discovery, tempered by court-
imposed deadlines with the goal of attaining streamlined and
cost-effective trial preparation by the parties culminating in a
trial with no surprises. The mutual exchange of information
through discovery also encourages the fair and cost-effective
resolution of disputes short of trial. That said, the very
integrity of the federal civil trial process hinges on the parties'
adherence to the foregoing principles and, most essentially,
upon the honesty and character of the attorneys involved.

*27  Here, the process failed miserably due to Radbil's and
later Myers' refusal to respect the process, follow the rules and
simply tell the truth. In a textbook example of what the Rules
are designed to avoid, RAB's counsel was unfairly forced
to fend off undisclosed evidence and misrepresentations by
Radbil at every turn during the trial. These tactics were both
distracting and costly to RAB as it attempted to defend its
case.
From the outset, Radbil's advocacy skills and overall
experience as a lawyer were of concern to the Court. Starting
at the pretrial phase, Radbil's late designation of witnesses241
followed by his inconsistent explanations for the untimely
designations were not in keeping with the actions of a
seasoned lawyer taking on the role of lead advocate for his
client at trial. Not only that, Radbil's seemingly inept tactics
were highly disconcerting to RAB as it attempted to prepare
for the trial just weeks away. So unsettling was Radbil's
naming of several unexpected witnesses to RAB in the weeks
before trial, that it filed two sets of objections to the witness
designations. Yet, due to Radbil's conflicting responses to
its objections, (first, no experts would testify then “one”
expert would testify), RAB was left in the dark as to Radbil's
intentions until the eve of trial. Only adding to RAB's distress,
as Malone recounted during the sanctions hearings, Radbil
refused to return her “ten” phone calls and “ten” e-mails the
Saturday before trial despite the Court's order that the parties
confer.
At trial, Radbil's unprofessional antics only worsened as did
its effects on RAB's ability to defend its case. First were
Radbil's attempts to introduce evidence to the jury about
never-before-disclosed counseling efforts by White. And then
came the surprise testimony by White that he had incurred
$45,000 in actual damages due to RAB's actions. As with
the untimely witness designations, this evidence (counseling
and $45,000 damages) was completely unexpected by RAB's
counsel and, at least temporarily, derailed their trial plan as
they had to search their files to support their objection to the
Court. But even recognizing these below-the-belt tactics as
such, a much more serious pattern of conduct on Radbil's part
emerged during the trial and in the sanctions hearings that
followed. That being Radbil's unabashed willingness to lie to
the Court to avoid negative consequences for his behavior.
Examples of this bad faith conduct abound in the fifty-pages
of factual findings. This troubling behavior came partly in
the form of Radbil's frustratingly evasive and circular non-
responses to simple questions about his conduct. For example,
as to the counseling evidence, Radbil firmly told the Court
during trial that he did not know what White's response
would be to the counseling question only to shift gears
moments later and state that he expected the testimony to be
favorable. As to RAB's claim that Radbil had “ambushed”
it with the $45,000 damages testimony, Radbil's circular,
threefold response, set forth in detail above, was simply
not believable in any sense, particularly once RAB was
able to point to portions of its records that contradicted
Radbil's response.242 Adding to the dubious nature of Radbil's
excuses at trial for offering the $45,000—and bordering on
the ridiculous—were the number of conflicting excuses that
followed throughout the later sanctions hearings. The excuses
from trial and the sanctions hearings included, but were not
limited to; that the $45,000 had been disclosed to RAB,
that the $45,000 was disclosed but not quantified, that the
$45,000 was not disclosed because it was mental anguish
damages, that it was not disclosed because it was privileged
and RAB never sought the privileged document, that it was
nothing but a “rogue” response by White never intended to
be offered, and, that it was never intended to be offered
because the $45,000 in damages was solely attributable to
Texas Guaranteed and not RAB. The fact that Radbil was
lying to the Court about the $45,000 was further substantiated
by his own client's comments, the day Radbil failed to appear
for trial, when he apologized to the Court that Radbil had
not been straightforward about the damages evidence. As
addressed multiple times above, this occurred during trial on
the morning that Radbil failed to appear.243
*28  Another example of Radbil's penchant for prevarication
was in his argument to the Court during trial that he needed
to recall RAB's Director of Compliance, Robert F. Wyatt, to
the witness stand to question Wyatt on a topic that he had,
according to Radbil, inadequately answered at his pretrial
deposition. In making his argument to the Court, Radbil
quoted from Wyatt's deposition. A key fact that Radbil
failed to disclose to the Court—but was later revealed by
RAB—was that the sufficiency of Wyatt's deposition, from
which Radbil quoted, had already been addressed during
pretrial discovery and remedied by the magistrate judge who
ordered a second deposition that corrected the problem. 244
Radbil's arguments and his quoting from the first deposition,
without mentioning the second, were blatantly misleading to
the Court. On top of that, once caught, Radbil refused to
acknowledge his misdeed to the Court either at trial or in the
post-trial sanctions hearings.245

During the sanctions hearings, Radbil's bad faith actions—in
tandem with Myers'—escalated. In question after question by
Malone, Radbil refused to concede the obvious, delaying the
proceedings and obfuscating the truth. For example, during
his testimony at the August 2, 2013 sanctions hearing, Radbil
refused to concede the simple truth that his Texas office
was actually just a post office box or that he had previously
been suspended from the practice of law for failing to pay
his dues.246 Similarly wanting, was his response to RAB's
counsel's question as to whether he had ever communicated
a reasonable settlement demand to RAB. So convoluted
and evasive was Radbil's answer, that the Court had to
intervene.247 And then, as mentioned, were his continually
evolving and conflicting excuses for the $45,000 in damages,
none of which were credible. He also switched his position
on the counseling issue from trial where he told the Court
he did not know whether White had sought counseling to the
sanctions hearing where he insisted that White had sought
counseling and had disclosed it to RAB. 248 On top of that,
there was absolutely no support at all for his claim either
that White had sought counseling or had ever disclosed such
efforts. Radbil simply lied to the Court about this, both at the
hearing and in his sanctions hearing briefing.
As discussed, Myers' entry into the case at the start of the
sanctions hearings, as Radbil's and the firm's representative,
only made matters worse, at times lending an almost ‘circus-
like’ atmosphere to the proceedings with Myers' ‘sleight-
of-hand’249 approach to the facts. First, and much to the
Court's surprise, in his opening statement, Meyers refused to
acknowledge that Radbil had done anything wrong during
trial—save showing up late for the second day of the
proceedings. Myers also oddly told the Court during his
opening that he had never even spoken to White about the
trial or the pending sanctions motions because he (Myers)
“didn't want to get a skewed vision of what happened.”
That Myers, the firm's representative, would not have even
spoken to the client about Radbil's handling of the client's
case when Radbil's handling of the case was the sole reason
for the sanctions motions was nonsensical. Myers' flimsy
justification for not talking to White was not credible. This is
particularly so given Myers' later production of the October
2, 2013 “Declaration” by White at the November 6, 2013
sanctions hearing. More specifically, even though Myers had
told the Court during his opening that he had purposely not
spoken to White in preparation for the sanctions hearing, he
not only later spoke to White, he had White sign a sworn
statement that was submitted by Myers as an exhibit at the
November 6, 2013 hearing. In this belated “Declaration” by
White, he disavowed that he had ever any intent to seek hard
damages from the jury, and parroted Meyers' and Radbil's
argument that Radbil and White had never planned to submit
such damage figures to the jury.
*29  As mentioned, the evidentiary value of White's belated
“Declaration” was questionable given White's absence from
the entirety of the sanctions proceedings and given that it
contradicted White's strong statements to the Court during
trial that he had intended to submit hard damages figures
to the jury. But what truly undermined the Declaration's
validity and called into question Myers' and Radbil's motives
in sponsoring the Declaration was the eventual disclosure
(during the last sanctions hearing) of the contents of White's
much earlier and highly contradictory December 6, 2012
pretrial memo to Radbil. As described above, Radbil had
the December 6, 2012 memo in his possession during all
of the proceedings and had alluded to it but refused to
disclose its contents, saying it was privileged and that RAB
had never established an exception to the privilege. All the
while, Radbil maintained that he and White had not planned
to seek hard damages from the jury. When it was finally
disclosed, over Radbil's counsel's objection, the December 6,
2012 memo corroborated what White told the Court during
trial that he and Radbil planned to seek hard damages from
the jury. Without White at the sanctions hearings to explain
the discrepancies between the two writings, the Court is left
to speculate as to whether the October 2, 2013 memo was
concocted by Myers and Radbil to support their defense to
the sanctions motions. One thing is certain and that is that the
fact that the two withheld the contents of the December 6,
2012 memo and prepared another memo for White's signature
that flatly contradicted the one in their possession smacks of
a fraud on the Court or, at the least, highly unprofessional
behavior that should not be countenanced in federal court.
Whether Radbil's and Myers' questionable behavior in this
case was an aberration or simply business as usual for
the firm, was clarified at the October 9, 2013 sanctions
hearing, which confirmed the latter. As addressed above,
through a series of documents from other court cases as
well information acquired from public web-sites controlled
by Myers, RAB was able to show that Radbil, Myers and
other members of the firm had been involved in multiple
run-ins with other courts and had fabricated information
about Radbil's accomplishments.250 One of the more notable
skirmishes was in the Scarlott case in the Southern District
of Texas, described above, in which the attorneys for

## Page 22

White v. Regional Adjustment Bureau, Inc., Not Reported in Fed. Supp. (2015)
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 22
Defendant Nissan filed a thirty-page motion for sanctions
accusing Radbil and his co-counsel of lying in their pleadings
in order to sustain an untenable case. 251 In granting the
motion for sanctions against Radbil and co-counsel and
awarding $195,000 to Nissan, the judge criticized Radbil
for his “abysmal judgment and performance” and described
the firm's actions in that case as “unconscionable” and
“unprincipled.”252 Another federal judge chastised Radbil
for “petty gamesmanship” while yet another accused him
of making “misrepresentations” regarding his eligibility to
practice law in that district.253
RAB was also able to show that Radbil and Myers (as the
sponsor of the public web-sites) fabricated information about
Radbil's experience and accomplishments on their public
web-sites. From claiming victories in cases that Radbil lost,
such as the Whaley case described above, to simply making up
stories about Radbil's purported clients, through public web-
sites, controlled by Meyers, Radbil and Myers shamelessly
lied to the public. 254 In one posting hailing Radbil as a
sort of pioneer in music downloading cases, the evidence
showed that Radbil was not even licensed to practice law
when that case went to trial.255 Same with a posting lauding
Radbil for his involvement in a major copyright infringement
case involving “Scribd,” which occurred before Radbil was
licensed as an attorney. 256 Another posting touts Radbil's
involvement in a case representing a group of NCAA athletes
when Radbil was never even listed as attorney of record. 257
Much more detail is set forth above and thus will not be
repeated. Suffice it to say, first, that none of this was refuted
by Radbil or Myers. And second, as set out above, clear and
convincing evidence reveals a pattern of conduct by Radbil
and Myers, with no ethical oversight, run amok. Sanctions for
bad faith conduct are most assuredly in order.
IV .
LEGAL STANDARDS
Sanctions—The Court's Inherent Authority
Federal courts have the inherent authority to manage their
own affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious
disposition of cases. Chambers v. NASCO, Inc. , 501 U.S.
32, 43-45 (1991)(citations omitted). Toward that end, federal
courts are empowered to sanction bad faith conduct occurring
during the litigation. Elliott v. Tilton, 64 F.3d 215, 216 (5th
Cir. 1995). It goes without saying that lying to the court 258
constitutes bad faith conduct. See generally, Chambers, 501
U.S. at 42, 46, 50-51  (upholding the district court's use of
its inherent authority to sanction bad faith conduct which
included “misleading and lying to the court.”). The court's
inherent authority is to be invoked, however, only when
“no sanction established by the Federal Rules or pertinent
statute is ‘up to the task,’ ” Chambers, 501 U.S. at 43-46 .
As explained by the Supreme Court in Chambers, certain
sanctioning mechanisms reach “only certain individuals or
conduct” but “the inherent power extends to a full range of
litigation abuses.” Id. at 46.
*30  Here, although RAB's motions for sanctions are
grounded in Fed. R. Civ. P. 37  and Title 28 U.S.C. § 1927 ,
which cover a certain range of the conduct alleged, neither are
up to the task of meting out the appropriate punishment for
the egregious conduct in this case. Specifically, recognizing
Radbil's undeniable misdeeds involving faulty pretrial
disclosures, late witness list supplementation, and the like,
it is his and Meyers' flagrant abuse of the judicial process
—their bad faith conduct—that is due the most scrutiny.
The scope of their conduct exceeds the conduct punishable
under Rule 37 and § 1927. To put a finer point on it, Radbil
and Meyers perpetrated a fraud on the Court and counsel
through a persistent pattern of misrepresentations, evasive
responses, and outright lies to the Court and counsel. To be
clear, the Court is not discounting Radbil's serial violations of
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or Meyers' and Radbil's
flouting of the rules of professional conduct. Instead, the
evidence of those violations, replete in fifty some odd pages
of this opinion, is considered in the aggregate by the Court
in concluding that Radbil and Meyers engaged in bad faith
conduct and, in so doing, abused the judicial process. Both
Meyers and Radbil were informed, more than once by the
Court, that their conduct was being scrutinized for bad faith
under the Court's inherent authority.259
Coextensive with the inherent authority to mete out sanctions
is the requirement that these implied powers be exercised
with restraint and discretion. Chambers, 501 U.S. at 44
(citing Roadway Express v. Piper, 447 U.S. 752, 764 (1980)).
Inherent powers “may be exercised only if essential to
preserve the authority of the court and the sanction must
employ” the least possible power adequate to the purpose
to be achieved. Natural Gas Pipeline of Am. v. Energy
Gathering Inc., 86 F. 3d 464, 467 (5th Cir. 1996) (citations
omitted). In other words, the sanction must “be tailored to
fit the particular wrong.” Topalian v. Ehrman, 3 F.3d 931,

936 n.5 (5th Cir. 1993) (extending the analytical principles
for determining sanctions under Rule 11 “across-the-board”
to all of the district court's sanctioning powers). The court's
inherent authority vests the court with discretion “to fashion
an appropriate sanction for conduct which abuses the judicial
process.” Chambers, 501 U.S. at 44-45 . Conduct which
abuses the judicial process includes, but is not limited to;
practicing a fraud upon the court as well as delaying or
disrupting litigation. Id. at 45-46 . Available sanctions under
the court's inherent authority include a number of options
ranging from an assessment of attorney's fees to disbarment.
Id.; In the Matter of Sealed Appellant, 194 F.3d 666, 671 (5th
Cir. 1999)(internal citations omitted).
Attorney's Fees
1. Trial Misconduct
RAB seeks to recover all of its attorney's fees and expenses for
its preparation and participation in the trial of this case. RAB
also seeks its attorney's fees and expenses for its preparation
for and appearance at all of the sanctions hearings. The Court
will address the trial fees first and then the fees incurred for
the sanctions proceedings. So far as its trial-related fees, RAB
seeks its costs and fees covering the time period from the
inception of the case, August, 2011 through the end of trial,
February 28, 2013.260
Appropriate factors to consider in determining the amount of
an award of attorney's fees sanction include: (1) the precise
conduct being punished; (2) the precise expenses caused by
the violation; (3) the reasonableness of the fees imposed; and
(4) the least severe sanction adequate to achieve the purpose
of the rule relied upon to impose the sanction. Topalian, 3 F.3d
at 936. Only those fees caused by the party's misconduct are
permissible. Smith & Fuller v. Cooper Tire & Rubber Co., 685
F.3d 486, 490 (5th Cir. 2012).
While it cannot be said that Radbil's unprofessional behavior
leading up to and continuing through the trial caused
all of RAB's trial attorney's fees, the Court finds that a
portion of those fees, beginning in December 2012 through
the end of trial in February 28, 2013, were incurred
as a direct result of Radbil's bad faith conduct. In so
finding, the Court incorporates, without repeating, its factual
findings, detailed above, regarding Radbil's trial conduct.
Just a few of the multitude of examples of this behavior
include when, immediately before trial, RAB's attorneys were
forced to research and file objections to Radbil's untimely
witness designations. Radbil never did provide an adequate
explanation for his untimely witness designations or his
inconsistent responses to RAB's objections to his witness
designations, leaving RAB in the dark as to Radbil's intended
witnesses until the pretrial conference. During trial, Radbil
improperly offered evidence on counseling and damages that
had never been disclosed to RAB before trial. This, in turn,
caught RAB by surprise, forcing it to object and spend time
researching its records and explaining to the Court precisely
why Radbil's actions were objectionable instead of focusing
on its trial strategy. The amount of time that RAB spent
going back through its own records to counter false statements
by Radbil is not adequately reflected in the trial transcript.
Nonetheless, the Court watched first-hand as RAB's attorneys
scrambled on several occasions to search their files to respond
to Radbil's misrepresentations during trial. And, of course,
persistent throughout the trial, were Radbil's evasive, circular
responses and outright misrepresentations to the Court which
disrupted and delayed the proceedings.261
*31  Having reiterated in general terms Radbil's offending
behavior at trial, the Court acknowledges that determining the
precise amount of RAB's attorney's fees—dollar-for-dollar
—that were directly caused by Radbil's bad faith conduct
at trial cannot be done with exactitude. In other words,
segregating the fees that RAB incurred as a direct result
of Radbil's misconduct from the fees that were otherwise
incurred by RAB in the course of trial does not lend itself to
numerical precision. But courts recognize that attorney fees
sanctions need not and sometimes cannot be calculated with
mathematical precision. Topalian v. Ehrman, 3 F.3d 931, 938
n. 7 (5th Cir. 1993) . The sanctioning court must, however,
provide “some avenue to trace [its] reasoning and review [its]
exercise of discretion.” Id.
Here, the Court's extensive involvement in the trial
proceedings and first-hand observation of Radbil's behavior
during the trial provides a substantial basis for quantifying
RAB's reasonable attorney's fees incurred due to Radbil's
behavior. While Radbil's unfortunate conduct permeated the
trial, it did not subsume all of the trial time. In this Court's
view, a conservative estimate by the Court of RAB's attorney's
fees that were caused by Radbil's conduct would be one-
third of the total attorney's fees incurred by RAB at trial.
The relevant time period for calculating these fees is between
December 2012 through February 28, 2013. To determine the
specific amount of fees due, additional records are needed
from RAB.262 This information should include all relevant
billing records for the time period from December 2012
through February 28, 2013, with a total figure of fees incurred

## Page 24

White v. Regional Adjustment Bureau, Inc., Not Reported in Fed. Supp. (2015)
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 24
for that time period divided by one-third. Having said that, the
Court notes that Malone testified credibly at the November 6,
2013 sanctions hearing about how she calculated RAB's fees
and costs incurred from the inception of the case through the
November 6th sanctions hearing. Her testimony covered and
satisfied all of the relevant “lodestar” considerations and such
information need not be resubmitted with these additional
records.263
*32  As mentioned, the Court's first-hand involvement in
the case made assessing the reasonableness of the fees
a much more straightforward task than that confronting
other courts deciding fee awards lacking this perspective.
Moreover, Malone's hourly rate was only $175. 264 This is
an extremely reasonable hourly rate for a lawyer of Malone's
experience.265 Malone's associates and paralegals 266 billed
at hourly rates of $140 and $80, respectively. 267 This award
is due and owing jointly and severally from Radbil and
Meyers. As set out in the factual findings, Meyers was
directly involved in this case before trial as a partner of the
Weisburg firm. Moreover, he dubiously defended Radbil's
trial conduct, seemingly perplexed by what he described as
“naked allegations” against Radbil. 268 The Court finds this
attorney's fee award to be the least severe sanction appropriate
to deter similar trial misconduct.
2. Sanctions Hearings
RAB also seeks its attorney's fees and costs in relation to
the sanctions motions and hearings that followed. This would
include all of its costs and fees incurred in preparing the
sanctions motions as well as those incurred in connection with
each of the sanctions hearings on August 2, 2013, August 7,
2013, October 9, 2013, November 6, 2013, and November
26, 2013. It is hardly a leap of logic to conclude that RAB's
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the sanctions
hearings were solely caused by Radbil's and Meyer's bad faith
conduct as detailed in the Court's factual findings. Under
appropriate circumstances, a sanction award may include the
entire amount of attorney's fees incurred as a result of the bad
faith conduct. Chambers, 501 U.S. at 55. Accordingly, RAB
is entitled to recover all of its reasonable attorney's fees and
expenses incurred in connection with preparing the sanctions
motions as well as for its preparation for and attendance at the
sanctions hearings.
Malone testified credibly at the November 6, 2013 sanctions
hearing regarding the amount of RAB's costs and expenses
incurred by her and her firm in connection with the sanctions
motions and hearings. For the same reasons discussed
above, Malone's testimony satisfied the lodestar factors. 269
Specifically, she established, inter alia, the reasonableness of
the fees and expenses RAB incurred, as well as her hourly
rate, the time, labor and skill required. The undesirability of
the case was clear from the record. Nonetheless, her testimony
and records covered RAB's expenses in connection with
the sanctions issues only up through her testimony at the
November 6, 2013 hearing. Given that the November 26,
2013 hearing had yet to occur, the evidence supporting RAB's
total sanction-related fees and expenses is incomplete. 270
Malone's credible testimony established that the total figure
for RAB's fees and expenses from the close of trial and
preparation of the sanctions motions through the November
6, 2013 hearing was $44,951.50.271 So, in order to adequately
and accurately compensate RAB for its total attorney's fees
and expenses incurred in connection with the sanctions issues,
RAB is directed to submit supplemental billing records (to
RAB-S Tab, 41) setting out its attorney's fees and expenses
incurred up through the conclusion of the November 26, 2013
sanctions hearing. Given the egregious conduct of both Radbil
and Meyers at the sanctions hearings, this fee award is due
and owing from both Radbil and Meyers and is also the least
sanction appropriate under the circumstances to compensate
RAB for its attorney's fees and expenses caused directly by
Radbil's and Meyers' conduct.
Suspension/Disbarment
*33  Finally, and most importantly, Radbil and Meyers must
be sanctioned for their egregious abuse of the judicial process.
Their systematic pattern of evasion, misrepresentation and
outright lies during the trial and the sanctions proceedings did
not just negatively impact RAB, it degraded the entire judicial
process. See Chambers, 501 U.S. at 42, 46  (misleading
and lying to the court degrades the judicial system). When
the integrity of the judicial process itself has been abused,
the court's authority to remedy the wrong derives from its
inherent power to police itself and to vindicate its judicial
authority. Id. at 45-46 . Toward that end, courts have the
right to “control admission to its bar and discipline attorneys
who appear before it.” Id. at 43 (internal citations omitted).
This includes the power to disbar an attorney for bad faith
conduct. Crowe v. Smith, 261 F.3d 558, 563 (5th Cir. 2001).272
“The power of disbarment is necessary to protect the public's
confidence in the profession and judicial system because
a court implicitly represents that an attorney permitted to

practice before it is in good standing to do so.” In re Sealed
Appellant, 194 F.3d at 674(internal citations omitted).
“Courts have long recognized an inherent authority to disbar
attorneys.” Id. at 671. A specific finding of bad faith by
the court is a prerequisite to disbarment. Id. The term “bad
faith” has been described as conduct involving “fraudulent
intent and a desire to suppress the truth.” Consolidated
Aluminum Corp. v. Alcoa, Inc., 244 F.R.D. 335, 344 (M.D. La.
2006). Misrepresentations to the court and other intentional
misconduct involving dishonesty, fraud, and deceit can be
grounds for disbarment. In re Sealed Appellant,  194 F.3d
at 674  (internal citation omitted); Crowe, 261 F.3d at 563 .
Because attorney disbarment is an extreme sanction, the
court's decision to disbar must be supported by clear and
convincing evidence of bad faith. Id.
With the foregoing standards in mind, the Court finds
that there is clear and convincing—if not overwhelming—
evidence that Radbil and Myers engaged in bad faith conduct
by lying to and otherwise misleading the Court and RAB's
counsel during the course of the proceedings. In so finding,
the Court relies upon its factual findings, in particular, its
summary of the factual findings for support.273 Some general
observations are also helpful. First, as evident in the 50-plus
pages of factual findings, Radbil's and Meyer's missteps were
by no means subtle. In other words, it does not require an
in-depth analysis to conclude that, on numerous occasions,
Radbil and Meyers were simply making things up. In fact,
many of their misrepresentations were startlingly obvious.
For example, Radbil's statement to the Court—when he asked
White during his trial testimony about counseling—that he
did not know what White's response would be and then,
a few minutes later, stating that he expected the testimony
to be favorable was just not logical. The same goes for
Radbil's numerous inconsistent statements about the $45,000
in damages testimony. With five or so internally inconsistent
explanations for the $45,000, one thing is certain: they cannot
all be true.
Myers fared no better. His opening statement at the August
2, 2013 sanctions hearing, in which he insisted to the Court
that he had not spoken to White because he did not want to
get a “skewed vision” of what happened during the trial made
no sense and called into question Meyers' fitness to practice
law. His later co-production of White's “Declaration” only
reinforced that he and Radbil were equal partners in their
abuse of the judicial process.274
*34  In sum, there is overwhelming evidence of bad faith
conduct by Radbil and Myers in this case. They must
therefore be called to account for their behavior. A simple
assessment of attorney's fees falls far short of what is
needed to deter Radbil's and Myers' bad faith conduct and
vindicate the judicial process. This, given the fact that both
attorneys and their former firm have had numerous ethical
run-ins with other courts in the past and, nevertheless,
conducted themselves as they did in this case. To prevent their
disreputable behavior from recurring, they must be precluded
from practicing in the Northern District of Texas for a defined
period of time. While disbarment is certainly an option, the
Court finds the lesser sanction of a three-year suspension is
adequate under the circumstances to accomplish the purpose
to sanctioning Radbil and Myers for their bad faith conduct
and to deter such conduct in the future. Accordingly both
Radbil and Myers are suspended from practicing law in
the Northern District of Texas for a period of three years
commencing on the date this Order is entered in this case.
After the three year period, Radbil and Myers may reapply
for admission but only on the condition that they have paid
the attorneys fees assessed against them and due and payable
to RAB.

51 The full account from this discussion between the Court and Radbil when the Court asks whether he had made the
$40,000 and $5000 damages disclosures reads:
MR. RADBIL: ... [describing when and how he disclosed the foregoing damages] ... And in our [Radbil's] supplemental
disclosures, our pretrial disclosures, we have amended that. I believe with respect to the charges that Mr. White
incurred, he incurred those after the deposition.
THE COURT: Where are the submissions that give them notice of the amount of damages that you are seeking outside
of the in initial response that Ms. Malone referred to? Where are they disclosed?
MR. RADBIL: In the pretrial order. They were disclosed at the mediated settlement conference.
THE COURT: Okay. Well, you know better than that. You know—the federal rules require you to respond to questions
about damages so that they can meet your proof at trial. So the fact that you discussed it in mediation doesn't count.
MR. RADBIL: Okay.
THE COURT: And you know that. And so the pretrial order—
MR. RADBIL: Pretrial disclosures.
THE COURT: The pretrial disclosures, okay. Show me where and what page and where those would be.
MR. RADBIL: I believe we copied and pasted from the pretrial order. I don't know if I have a copy of our pretrial
disclosures with me.
THE COURT: Ms. Malone, do you have those?
MS. MALONE: Yes, ma'am, I sure do.
THE COURT: Thank you.
Mr. Radbil, take a seat. Let me hear what she has to say.
MS. MALONE: Your Honor, just so you know, the first entry under tab 6 is his original disclosures. I apologize for the
highlighting. And the second one behind the yellow sheet is his supplemental.
THE COURT: And they are not in there?
MS. MALONE: They are.
THE COURT: As far as—
MS. MALONE: The references to the damages is not included in the supplemental.
THE COURT: Mr. Radbil?
MR. RADBIL: I don't know what document—

THE COURT: Okay. Let's have you take a look at it.
MR. RADBIL: Defendant's wrongful conduct caused the plaintiff to suffer legitimate actual damages. Plaintiff's actual
damages not only include out-of-pocket expenses but also damages for personal humiliation—
THE COURT: What exactly are you reading from?
MR. RADBIL: Defendant's APP018, document 76-1.
THE COURT: I guess my question is, where is it in there that talks about this amount of money above the $1,500 that
you initially disclosed. And I think it would be better if you went back to the microphone.
MR. RADBIL: It's not quantified.
THE COURT: So they weren't on notice of the amounts that you have come up with here during the testimony at trial.
MR. RADBIL: Through our settlement negotiations.
THE COURT: Okay.
MR. RADBIL: And—
THE COURT: ...
Go ahead. What else? Where else?
MR. RADBIL: Certainly not here.
THE COURT: So you agree that the amounts that were talked about were never specifically disclosed.
MR. RADBIL: I don't know the definitive answer, but I know that we have supplemented and they [RAB] have been on
notice of a significant amount of actual damage for a long time.
THE COURT: By virtue of what?
MR. RADBIL: I don't have all of our discovery responses.
THE COURT: You can't tell me off the top of your head where you might have disclosed the specific amount beyond
the $1,500?
MR. RADBIL: A specific amount? I don't know whether we did disclose a specific amount.
THE COURT: I've heard enough. Anything else?
MR. RADBIL: There's a requirement to disclose the exact amount of the damages that we're seeking?
THE COURT: What is your position on that?
MR. RADBIL: That the damages—
THE COURT: You have a federal practice, is that what you say?
MR. RADBIL: I'm sorry?
THE COURT: You have a federal practice, is that what you say?
MR. RADBIl: You have a federal practice, and you don't know the answer to the question ?

MR. RADBIL: He's seeking damages—
THE COURT: How about a straight answer?
MR. RADBIL:—for mental anguish and emotional distress.
THE COURT: How about a straight answer? You don't know the answer to that question?
MR. RADBIL: That is a straight answer to the question.
THE COURT: That you have no obligation to quantify your damages in federal practice when asked in discovery and
even by virtue of the disclosure requirement. You're saying that you don't know if that's a requirement. You don't know
that that's a requirement. That's what you have said. Am I right?
MR. RADBIL: That's a question for—the jury determines the actual amount of damages.
THE COURT: Mr. Radbil, I have never heard more prevarication in my life. Have a seat. Have a seat.

87 Because there are multiple instances of misconduct by Radbil complained of by RAB, (i.e. Radbil's failure to properly
prepare for trial, to timely file and serve his exhibit list on RAB; his failure to provide the Court with any exhibits, etc.), the
Court, for the most part, confines its discussion to the most serious violations.

92 The discussion on his suspension mirrored his circular method of avoiding a straight answer to a straightforward
questions:
Q. (By Malone): Mr. Radbil, during the course of this case on the second deposition that was taken of Bob Wyatt, at that
time you were technically suspended from the State Bar of Texas for failure to pay your bar dues; isn't that correct?
A. (Radbil): I don't know the answer to that. I don't recall the exact date when that occurred.... I know that you and I had a
case in the Dallas County District Court, and before court one morning I came in and was sitting next to you. And then we
made our appearances on the record, at which time you said there was a housekeeping matter, Judge. It's come to my
attention that Mr. Radbil has been—his law license has been suspended for not paying bar dues, at which point—and this
is all on the record. Of course I was surprised and shocked and told the judge that was news to me, that it was something
that my firm handles as a logistical matter for me. And you said that I couldn't appear in court. And we actually called the

State Bar on a conference call and found out that what I had to do was just to pay my dues immediately and that I could
do that online, and we took care of that online and proceeded. So there's a record of that, and I would defer the Court—
Q.(Court): You were suspended, she was right, correct?
A. (Radbil): I don't know whether ...
Q. (Court): Oh, come on, Mr. Radbil. You were suspended when she said you were suspended, you just agreed to it
by talking about what you did with the State Bar; you were suspended when she said you were suspended during that
case for not paying your dues, correct?
A. (Radbil): I don't know the answer to that. I think the fee issue is the eligible practice versus merit-based suspension.
Q. (Court): Were you suspended from the practice of law for not paying your dues?
A. (Radbil): I would have to contact the State Bar and find out the answer to that.
Q. (Court): So you don't know the answer.
A. (Radbil): Correct.

Q. (Malone): Isn't it also true that following the summary judgment motion only Mr. Meyers communicated with me
regarding settlements.
A. (Radbil): That's incorrect.
Q. (Malone): Are you saying that you communicated with me regarding settlements after the summary judgment ruling
by the Court?
A. (Radbil): Specifically, yes.
Q. (Malone): At mediation only.
A. (Radbil): No, prior to.
Q. (Malone): When did you communicate a demand to me, Mr. Radbil?
A. (Radbil): I remember—I have an e-mail in one of the binders that you and I are discussing settlement, particularly my
view that our clients would hopefully resolve this matter at the mediated settlement conference so we wouldn't have to
try Dr. White's remaining claims.
THE COURT: The question she [Malone] asked you was, when did you communicate a demand to her?
A. (Radbil): There was an initial demand before we filed suit, and then far before the mediated settlement conference
there was an $8,500 demand that was communicated to Ms. Malone.
THE COURT: By you?
A. (Radbil): Personally, no, it was not.

Q. (By Ms. Malone): My question is: When did you relay any demands to me prior to the mediated settlement conference,
Mr. Radbil?
A. (Radbil): Relay or personally—I didn't personally—
Q. (Malone): Personally give me one, Mr. Radbil.
A. (Radbil): I don't recall whether I did or not. I may have—
Q. (Malone):Thank you, sir.
A. (Radbil):—but we certainly—
Q. (Malone): Okay. Now, Mr. Radbil, at the mediated settlement conference, did you make a demand in excess of
$100,000?
A. (Radbil): Does the Court allow me to talk about the mediated settlement conference?
THE COURT: I want you to answer the question; yes.
A. (Radbil): After discussing with my client at length and based on the strategy that I had prepared in good faith to try to
settle this matter, I think that, yes, a demand over $100,000 was made, although I don't recall the specific amount.
Q. (Malone): Did Judge Stickney tell you that demand was inappropriate in a case with the kind of damages we had.
A. (Radbil): I don't recall. I don't think so....

154 Q. (by Malone): If you would look with me, sir, at Exhibit Number 15. This is a motion for new trial that was filed by Mr.
Radbil in a case in Tarrant County. Do you see that?
A. (Meyers): Yes.
Q: Would you turn with me to page 765, which would be the last paragraph or the last section in that motion.
A: I am here.
Q: Do you see here that Mr. Radbil is making a motion to the Court indicating that he believes that a counsel must exhaust
their peremptory strikes prior to the Court making rulings on motions for cause on jurors?
A: Could you repeat that, please?
Q: Sure. If you need to read it, please do so, sir. Do you see from this particular section that Mr. Radbil is making the
argument that counsel must exhaust their peremptory strikes prior to the Court ruling on motion to cause strikes on
particular jurors?
A: Okay. I have read that.
Q: Okay. And that's essentially what he's saying, is he not, Mr. Meyers?
A: I'm sorry, would you repeat the question one last time?
Q: Sure. Would you agree with me that he is arguing that the Court should have required the peremptory strikes to be
exhausted prior to making rulings on motions for cause.

A: I think the pleading says what it says, but I don't have a reason to disagree with what you are saying.
Q: Okay. And that's not the way the jury selection works, does it, Mr. Meyers?
A: I think the rules speak for themselves.
Q: I am asking you, sir, as a supervising attorney, is that the way jury selection is supposed to work?
...
THE COURT: Okay.
A. (By Meyers): I believe—and I could be wrong—that you strike for cause and then you do peremptory challenges.
Q. (By Ms. Malone): So as of September 2011, when Mr. Radbil filed this motion, he at least did not appear to understand
the process for jury selection, is that fair?
A: I can't say that.
Q. Did you read the transcript from the Brown trial, sir?
A: I've read parts of it, yes, and I may have fully read it on one occasion.
Q: Okay.
A: But it would have been a very long time ago.
Q: Okay. So as of 2011, Mr. Radbil filed a motion that would indicate he didn't understand the jury looks like that is the
argument being made. So the question is: Do you agree that this would be incorrect?
...
THE WITNESS: I'm a little confused by the questions back and forth, but I do agree and believe that you would strike for
cause and then exercise peremptory challenges, if that's what's being asked.
THE COURT: All right.
Q. (By Ms. Malone): Thank you.

156 RAB-S at Tabs 15–42, 44. Radbil and Meyers are entitled to due process before sanctions are awarded against them by
the Court. Due process, in turn, requires notice and a meaningful opportunity for them to be heard. Ingram v. Glast, Phillips
& Murray, 196 Fed.Appx. 232, 233 (5th Cir. 2006). Due process, however, does not necessarily require that those facing
sanctions be afforded an evidentiary hearing or even a hearing on arguments alone before being subject to sanctions.
Id. (citing Merriman v. Sec. Ins., 100 F.3d 1187, 1191-92 (5th Cir. 1996); see also Cook v. American S.S. Co., 134 F.3d
771, 774-75 (6th Cir. 1998)). Here, Radbil, Meyers and the Weisburg firm were afforded notice of the pending sanctions
motions, an opportunity to respond via briefing and exhibits, four full evidentiary hearings and the ability to offer evidence
in the form of exhibits and testimony at those hearings. Even so, some of the “other case misconduct” exhibits offered by
RAB were not, in this Court's view, sufficiently supported by the record or the testimony to constitute reliable, probative
evidence for the Court's consideration. Though the Federal Rules of Evidence do not necessarily apply to sanctions
proceedings, the Court will not credit tenuously supported proof with probative value. Thus, unless a particular exhibit is
cited by the Court as being considered, RAB's exhibits and testimony relating to other case misconduct is disregarded.

172 The sheer complexity and high profile nature of some of the cases listed on the firm's website as handled by a newly-

obligation to do so as the firm's managing partner, he did not verify the accuracy of these entries before they were posted,
none of these claims were supported by any evidence at the hearing. Meyers also professed ignorance as to the veracity
of several questionable postings, one lauding Radbil's representation of a “major league” baseball player in a seven figure
breach of fiduciary duty case and another touting Radbil's work in a “seven-figure condemnation action concerning a City

261 For a sampling, see notes 51, 92, and 95, supra.
262 Although RAB presented testimony from Malone and exhibits at the sanctions hearings supporting its attorney's fee
request, the Court finds that additional information is needed for clarity. Specifically, Ms. Malone testified about attorney's
fees incurred at trial but the records she relied upon were documents submitted in connection with RAB's Rule 68 motion
(doc. 118), STR-4 at 112-55. The records attached to the Rule 68 motion (doc. 118) contain listings of fees and expenses
from the inception of the case in August 2011 through the end of the trial. See Doc. 118, Def. App. 155-315. Those records
also include affidavits by RAB's attorneys and paralegals as well as other documents supporting the reasonableness of
RAB's fee requests. Id., Def. App. 316-50. But the fees that are being awarded in this case for Radbil's misconduct cover
a more limited time period. Specifically, it is Radbil's misconduct, during and immediately prior to trial, for which fees are
being awarded. As stated above, the precise figure allowable would be one third of the attorney's fees incurred as a result
of Radbil's conduct between December 2012 and the end of trial, February 28, 2013. Costs in amount of $9,438.73 in
the case have already been ordered by separate order and cannot be included in this total.
263 STR-4 at135-56; A “strong presumption” of reasonableness attaches to attorney's fees calculated under the lodestar
method. Smith & Fuller, 685 F.3d at 490 (citing Heidtman v. County of El Paso, 171 F.3d 1038, 1044 (5th Cir. 1999)).
Those factors include: (1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the case; (3) the skill required; (4)
the preclusion of other employment; (5) the customary fee; (6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent; (7) time limitations
imposed; (8) the results obtained; (9) the experience, reputation and ability of the attorneys; (10) the undesirability of the
case; (11) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client; and (12) awards in similar cases. Johnson
v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714, 717-19 (5th Cir. 1974).
264 Malone testified that as of November 2013, her hourly rate increased to $200. STR-4 at 138.
265 In other cases involving Texas lawyers, the hourly rates range from $220 for associates to $510 for senior partners. E.g.,
Champion v. ADT Sec. Servs., Inc., No. 2:08-CV-417-TJW, 2010 WL 4736908, at * 8-9 (E.D. Tex. Nov. 16, 2010)(finding
that $350 for partner-level work is reasonable given that the hourly rates for partners in the Eastern District of Texas range
from $250 per hour to $450 per hour “for certain premium work”); Randolph v. Dimension Films, 634 F. Supp. 2d 779,
797-98 (S.D. Tex. 2009)(finding that rates of $510 per hour for a partner specializing in intellectual property law and $220
to $300 per hour for associates are reasonable); cf., e.g., Ranger Steel Servs., LP v. Orleans Materials & Equipment, No.
10-112, 2010 WL 3488236, at *1 (E.D. La. Aug. 27, 2010)(finding that hourly rates of $395 for partners are reasonable);
Hornbeck Offshore Servs., L.L.C. v. Salazar, No. 10-1663, 2011 WL 2214765, at *2 (E.D. La. June 1, 2011)(finding hourly
rates of $295 to $420 for partners and $180 to $195 for associates “are at the high end of rates,” but finding an hourly
rate of $450 reasonable for a partner with specialized qualifications).
266 See Greer v. Richardson Indep. Sch. Dist., 471 Fed.Appx. 336, 340 (5th Cir. 2012) (approving an award of attorney's
