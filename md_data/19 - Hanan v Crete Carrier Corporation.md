MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
JANE J. BOYLE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
*1  Before the Court are Defendants’ Motions to Strike the
Report and Opinions of Walter A. Guntharp, Jr. and Jason
Marcetti, M.D. (Docs. 53 & 56). Plaintiff commissioned
Mr. Guntharp to opine on Defendant Dorn Knapp's conduct
before, during, and after the accident, and Dr. Marcetti
on Plaintiff's future medical expenses. For the reasons that
follow, Defendants’ Motion to Strike the Report and Opinions
of Walter A. Guntharp, Jr. (Doc. 53) is GRANTED in part
and DENIED in part , and Defendants’ Motion to Strike
the Report and Opinions of Dr. Jason Marcetti (Doc. 56) is
DENIED.
I.
BACKGROUND1
On June 18, 2018, Susan Hanan was traveling on Interstate
45 in Navarro County, Texas, when her vehicle was hit by
Defendant Crete Carrier Corporation's tractor trailer. Doc.
4, Pl.’s Original Pet., ¶ 6. The vehicle was being driven by
Defendant Knapp, who was an employee of Crete at the
time. Id. Hanan further alleges that she was hit when “Knapp
changed lanes unsafely into the lane in which [Hanan] was
lawfully driving, crashing into [Hanan's] vehicle at a high rate
of speed.” Id.
Hanan subsequently brought this lawsuit against both Crete
and Knapp. Id. ¶¶ 4–5. Hanan alleges that she suffered severe
injuries to her head , neck, back, and other body parts as a
result of the accident. Id. ¶ 6.
Hanan originally brought six causes of action, five of
which survived Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment
(Doc. 42): (1) negligence and gross negligence against both
Defendants; (2) negligent hiring against Crete; (3) negligent
training against Crete; (4) negligent supervision, retention,
and monitoring against Crete; and (5) negligent entrustment
against Crete. See Doc. 91, Mem. Op. & Order, 2, 16.
To further her case, Hanan retained Mr. Guntharp and Dr.
Marcetti as experts. Mr. Guntharp, Jr. was commissioned to
opine on Mr. Knapp's conduct before, during, and after the
car accident in relation to commercial truck driving standards.
Doc. 71, Pl.’s App., Ex. C (Guntharp Report). Dr. Marcetti
was commissioned to opine on the amount of Hanan's future
medical expenses as a result of the car accident. Doc. 68, Pl.’s
App., Ex. C (Marcetti Report).
Defendants now move to exclude both Mr. Guntharp and Dr.
Marcetti's testimony (Docs. 53 & 56). All briefing has been
submitted, and the motions are now ripe for review.
II.
LEGAL STANDARD
Federal Rule of Evidence 702  provides for testimony by an
expert witness if: (1) that witness is “qualified as an expert
by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education”;
(2) “the expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized

knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the
evidence or to determine a fact in issue”; (3) “the testimony
is based on sufficient facts or data” ; (4) “the testimony is
the product of reliable principles and methods”; and (5) “the
expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to
the facts of the case.” Fed. R. Evid.  702. The “testimony is
admissible only if it is both relevant and reliable.” Kumho Tire
Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 141 (1999) (citing Daubert
v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc. , 509 U.S. 579, 597 (1993) ).
The party offering expert testimony bears the burden of
establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the
testimony satisfies Rule 702. See Mathis v. Exxon Corp., 302
F.3d 448, 459–60 (5th Cir. 2002).
*2  “The court decides these motions in its role as gatekeeper
concerning the admissibility of expert testimony.” Hall Arts
Ctr. Office, LLC v. Hanover Ins. Co. , 327 F. Supp. 3d 979,
1001 (N.D. Tex. 2018) (citing Pipitone v. Biomatrix, Inc., 288
F.3d 239, 244 (5th Cir. 2002)). “Vigorous cross-examination,
presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on
the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means
of attacking shaky but admissible evidence.” Daubert, 509
U.S. at 596.
III.
ANALYSIS
A. Walter A. Guntharp's Testimony
Mr. Guntharp opined that (1) Defendant Knapp was
intentional, or at the very least reckless, leading up to
the accident; (2) if not for Defendant Knapp's actions,
the accident would not have occurred; and (3) Defendant
Knapp did not comply with industry standards while driving
Defendant Crete's tractor trailer leading up to the accident.
See Doc. 71, Pl.’s App., Ex. C (Guntharp Report), 4–5.
Defendants raise four grounds to strike Mr. Guntharp's
testimony: Mr. Guntharp's opinions (1) do not show how
compliance with applicable federal and state laws and
industry standards are relevant to the case and “do not identify
or analyze any relevant laws, regulations, standards or
practices[;]” (2) improperly parrot and bolster the testimony
of fact witnesses; (3) “are speculative and not tied to the
facts through proper analysis[;]” and (4) offer accident
reconstruction conclusions for which Mr. Guntharp is not
qualified. Doc. 53, Defs.’ Mot., 1.
Hanan responds by arguing that: “(1) Mr. Guntharp's opinions
are reliable because there is no analytical gap between the
facts [of the case] and his opinions”; (2) Mr. Guntharp is
qualified to offer opinions in the case, and is not attempting
to reconstruct the scene of the accident; and (3) “virtually all
of Defendants” objections “go towards the weight, and not
the admissibility, of Mr. Guntharp's opinions.” Doc. 70, Pl.’s
Resp., 7–12.
The Court concludes that Mr. Guntharp's testimony as to
Defendant Knapp's state of mind and the cause of the accident
is inadmissible expert testimony and must be stricken from
the record. This includes all of conclusions (1), (2), (5),
(6), (7), (8), and (9), and portions of conclusions (3) and
(4). See Doc. 71, Pl.’s App., Ex. C (Guntharp Report), 4–
5. As to conclusion (3), Mr. Guntharp's conclusion that
“[i]nstead, with reckless disregard for the safety of Ms.
Hanan, [Defendant Knapp] operated his large tractor-trailer
in an aggressive manner that ultimately resulted in this crash”
must be stricken. See id. at 5. As to conclusion (4), the
Court strikes Mr. Guntharp's conclusions that “Mr. Knapp's
actions as described by witness Brown were representative of
road rage and an intentional attempt to prevent Ms. Hanan
from entering his lane of travel” and that “[t]hese actions ...
represented outrageous conduct on the part of Mr. Knapp.”
See id. Finally, conclusions (1) and (5) must be stricken as
well, as they are not helpful to a jury. See id.
1. Mr. Guntharp's opinions as to Defendant Knapp's state
of mind in conclusions (2), (7), and portions of conclusions
(3) and (4) are all inadmissible expert testimony and must
be stricken.
Conclusions (2), the above portions of (3) and (4), and (7)
all opine on Defendant Knapp's state of mind at the time
of the accident. See, e.g. , id. at 4–5, Conclusion (2) (“Mr.
Knapp intentionally attempted to prevent Ms. Hanan from
passing....”); Conclusion (3) (concluding that Knapp was
acting with “reckless disregard for the safety of Ms. Hanan);
Conclusions (4) and (7).
*3  “[A] trial court may strike expert testimony that
evaluates a party's state of mind, as that evaluation is within
the province of the jury.” Fisher v. Halliburton , 2009 WL
5216949, at *2 (S.D. Tex. Dec. 21, 2009)  (citing Marlin v.
Moody Nat'l Bank, N.A. , 248 F. App'x 534, 541 (5th Cir.
2007) (per curiam)). A trial court may do so because “[a]n
expert's credentials do not place him in a better position than
the [trier of fact] to draw conclusions about a defendant's state

## Page 3

Hanan v. Crete Carrier Corporation, Not Reported in Fed. Supp. (2020)

of mind.” Id. (alterations in original) (citing Marlin, 248 F.
App'x at 541).
In Fisher, the court considered expert testimony that opined
that a party “knew that the death or serious injury of its
drivers was substantially certain” and that the party's actions
“[rose] to the level of specific intent.” Id. at *3 . The court
concluded that these were “evaluations of the mental state of
the defendants’ employees” and were “not [ ] helpful to a trier
of fact....” Id. Accordingly, the court granted the motion to
strike the expert testimony. Id.
Here, the Court is confronted with the same type of testimony
as in Fisher. Mr. Guntharp's testimony concludes, for
example, that Defendant Knapp's actions were “intentional
attempt[s] to prevent Ms. Hanan from passing” and
“represented a conscious and reckless disregard for the safety
of Ms. Hanan.” Doc. 71, Pl.’s App., Ex. C (Guntharp Report),
4–5. The Court thus GRANTS Defendants’ motion to strike
(Doc. 53) the aforementioned conclusions on state of mind,
and all other portions of the report that opine on Defendant
Knapp's state of mind. See, e.g., id. at 6 (“Mr. Knapp ... acted
in a reckless manner....”).
2. Conclusions (1) and (5) do not require the testimony of
an expert and must be stricken.
Conclusion (1) of Mr. Guntharp's report states, “[o]n the
day of the crash, Mr. Knapp was in the scope of his
employment with Crete Carrier Corporation (Crete).” See id.
at 4. However, Mr. Guntharp does not explain the bases of
this conclusion anywhere in his report. See id. at 4–8. Thus,
this conclusion must be stricken. See Fed. R. Evid.  702(d)
(explaining that “the expert [must] ha[ve] reliably applied the
principles and methods [giving rise to his testimony] to the
facts of the case”).
Additionally, Conclusion (5) of Mr. Guntharp's report states,
in full:
After the crash, Mr. Knapp communicated via CB radio
with Mr. Brown, a truck driver who had witnessed the crash
and denied striking the Hanan vehicle. He then continued
down the roadway for approximately a mile before pulling
over onto the shoulder and awaiting the police.
Doc. 71, Pl.’s App., Ex. C (Guntharp Report), 5. Such facts
do not require the help of an expert for the jury to understand,
and thus this conclusion is inadmissible. See In re C.R. Bard,
Inc., 948 F. Supp. 2d 589, 608 (S.D. W. Va. 2013) (“Expert
testimony which merely regurgitates factual information that
is better presented directly to the jury rather than through
the testimony of an expert witness is properly excluded.”)
(quotations and internal citation omitted).
Thus, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion (Doc. 53) as
to conclusions (1) and (5) of Mr. Guntharp's testimony.
3. Mr. Guntharp's opinions that Mr. Knapp's actions were
the cause of the crash in conclusions (2), (3), (6), (7), (8),
and all of conclusion (9) must be stricken.
The Court strikes all conclusions as to the cause of the
crash. This includes portions of conclusions (2), (3), (6),
(7), and (8), and all of conclusion (9). See Doc. 71, Pl.’s
App., Ex. C (Gunhtarp Report), 4–5. Similar to the rationale
behind the bar on state-of-mind testimony explained above,
asking an expert witness to opine on the legal cause of an
accident “is [an] issue the jury must resolve....” Owen v. Kerr-
McGee Corp., 698 F.2d 236, 240 (5th Cir. 1983) . Although
Federal Rule of Evidence 704  allows testimony that might
“embrace[ ] an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of
fact,” id. at 240 (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 704), “the rule [is not]
intended to allow a witness to give legal conclusions.” Id. at
240 (emphasis in original).
*4  Yet, opining on legal conclusions is exactly what Mr.
Guntharp has done in his report. Like in Owen, “there [is]
no dispute in the evidence as to the factual cause of the
mishap,” which is the accident between Hanan and Defendant
Knapp. See id. ; see also  Doc. 43, Def.’s Br. in Supp. of
Mot. for Summ. J., 2 (“This lawsuit arises from a sideswipe
accident that occurred on June 18, 2018 between [Hanan]
and a Crete tractor trailer rig driven by Dorn Knapp.”). Thus,
it is “obvious” that Mr. Guntharp is attempting to opine on
whether Mr. Knapp's actions were the but-for and proximate
cause of the accident. See Owen, 698 F.2d at 239–40 . For
example, Mr. Guntharp concludes many times, using different
words, that “[h]ad Mr. Knapp acted in a safe, professional
manner, this crash would not have occurred.” Doc. 71, Pl.’s
App., Ex. C (Guntharp Report), 5. The Court will ask the jury
—not a witness, even one who is an expert—to make such
conclusions. See Owen, 698 F.2d at 240 (“Whether or not [the
plaintiff's] acts were the ‘cause of the accident’ is the issue
the jury must resolve....”).
For the foregoing reasons, Mr. Guntharp's testimony that
Mr. Knapp's actions caused the accident (or alternatively, if
Mr. Knapp did not act in a certain way, the accident would
not have occurred) must be stricken. The Court GRANTS
Defendants’ motion to strike (Doc. 53) to this extent.

4. Mr. Guntharp's opinions about whether Mr. Knapp
complied with driving standards in conclusions (3) and (4)
are admissible.
Mr. Guntharp's conclusions that Defendant Knapp did
not follow commercial driver standards before or during
the accident are admissible. This includes the following
conclusions:
3. The construction zone and associated traffic conflicts
required that a commercial driver be especially careful.
Mr. Knapp failed to meet this standard....
4. ... These actions are far outside the scope of industry
expectations....
Doc. 71, Pl.’s App., Ex. C (Guntharp Report), 5. Unlike
Mr. Guntharp's other conclusions and testimony, these
conclusions satisfy Rule 702 ’s requirements for expert
testimony. First, Mr. Guntharp is qualified as an expert. He
has worked as a field safety representative for a transportation
insurance company, and has provided defensive driving
courses to commercial drivers for the state of Indiana. Id. at
30. He has been involved in the commercial transportation
industry since 1976. Id.; see also Fed. R. Evid.  702 (listing
experience as one way in which someone can qualify as an
expert).
Next, in his report, Mr. Guntharp listed the materials relevant
to the accident that he reviewed, and the knowledge of
commercial driving standards that he has acquired through
his experience in the industry. See Doc. 71, Pl.’s App.,
Ex. C (Guntharp Report), 4–5; see also  Fed. R. Evid.  702
(explaining that to be admissible, expert testimony must
be “based on sufficient facts or data,” and “the product of
reliable principles and methods,” and the expert must have
“reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the
case”). Thus, the Court disagrees with Defendants’ arguments
that Mr. Guntharp “does not mention what these industry
standards are; where he found them; how they have been
tested, applied or otherwise shown to be reliable; how they
are relevant to this case; or how he analyzed or evaluated
Defendants’ compliance with them.” Doc. 54, Def.’s Br.,
7–8. Instead, Defendants’ arguments go to the weight, not
the admissibility, of Mr. Guntharp's testimony. See Lofton v.
McNeil Consumer & Speciality Pharms., 2008 WL 4878066,
at *4 (N.D. Tex. July 25, 2008)  (refusing to exclude expert
testimony when the “validity of expert testimony ... [was] a
question of weight, not admissibility”) (citation omitted).
Additionally, Defendants argue that “Defendants’ general
compliance with regulations, practices and standards is not
relevant to this lawsuit.” Doc. 54, Defs.’ Br., 3. The Court
disagrees. Compliance with standards of care in an industry
is relevant to whether a defendant breached the standard
of care in a negligence case. See Idar v. Cooper Tire &
Rubber Co., 2010 WL 3702579, at *3 (S.D. Tex. Sept. 15,
2010) (“In negligence claims, courts often look to compliance
with industry standards to determine if a defendant was
negligent.”) (citation omitted).
*5  Consequently, the Court DENIES Defendants’ motion
to strike (Doc. 53) insofar as it seeks to strike Mr. Guntharp's
testimony related to Defendant Knapp's noncompliance with
commercial driving standards.
B. Dr. Jason Marcetti's Testimony
Dr. Marcetti testified that Ms. Hanan's future medical
requirements would be $302,680.61. Doc. 68, Pl.’s App.,
Ex. C (Marcetti Report), 1. Dr. Marcetti included in his
calculations (1) physician services; (2) routine diagnostics;
(3) medications; (4) laboratory studies; (5) rehabilitation
services; and (6) acute care services. Id.
Defendants raise two grounds to strike Dr. Marcetti's
testimony. Defendants note that when calculating Hanan's
future medical expenses, Dr. Marcetti failed to analyze (1)
charge rates by Hanan's specified providers; and (2) the
availability of Medicare. Doc. 57, Defs’ Br., 3–6. Thus,
Defendants argue that Dr. Marcetti's expert testimony is not
reliable as required by Daubert. Id. at 5.
First, Defendants believe that in calculating the cost of
Hanan's future medical care, Dr. Marcetti failed to consider
Hanan's “insurance status and the rate negotiated by the
provider with the insurer.” Id. at 4 (citing Haygood v. De
Escabedo, 356 S.W.3d 390, 393–94 (Tex. 2011)). Defendants
argue that such considerations are required under Texas
law, specifically that “recovery of medical or health care
expenses incurred is limited to the amount actually paid or
incurred....” Doc. 57, Defs.’ Br., 4 (citing Tex. Civ. Prac.
& Rem. Code Ann.  § 41.0105 ). Defendants suggest that by
failing to take into consideration what Hanan's providers
will actually charge, or what Hanan will actually pay, Dr.
Marcetti's “methodology is not reliable and his analysis is not
relevant or helpful to the jury in this case....” Id. at 4–5.
Second, and relatedly, Defendants contend that in his
calculations, Dr. Marcetti does not account for the fact that

## Page 5

Hanan v. Crete Carrier Corporation, Not Reported in Fed. Supp. (2020)
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 5
Hanan is a Medicare recipient. Id. at 5. Thus, Defendants
believe, Dr. Marcetti's opinion “is not based on and does
not relate to the facts at issue and is not relevant to any
issue in the case.” Id. Defendants rely on Haygood v. De
Escabedo, where the Texas Supreme Court concluded that
imposing damages on a defendant based on expenses that a
health care provider would not be entitled to charge would
“create a windfall for the plaintiff and is inconsistent with the
concept of compensatory damages.” Doc. 57, Defs.’ Br., 5
(citing Haygood, 356 S.W.3d at 396–97).
The Court finds Defendants’ arguments unavailing. As Hanan
points out, and Defendants concede, Haygood and Section
41.0105 set out rules for past, not future, medical expenses.
See Doc. 67, Pl.’s Resp., 13–14; Doc. 78, Defs.’ Reply, 3.
Defendants argue in their reply that their “argument is not
simply a Section 41.0105 argument.” Doc. 78, Defs.’ Reply,
3. But that's not what they say in their original brief on this
motion. See Doc. 57, Defs.’ Br., 4 (“That is, Marcetti does not
show, as required by § 41.0105, what charges [Hanan] will
actually pay or incur for her future care.”) (emphasis added).
Nor is the Court persuaded by Defendants’ argument that
“there is no principled reason why, when [information
regarding Medicare and insurance status, among other
factors] is available for future medical expenses, such factors
should not be considered for future costs as well.” Doc. 78,
Defs.’ Reply, 4. Such considerations are not required under
Texas law. “In order to recover for future medical expenses
under Texas law, the plaintiff must show there is a reasonable
probability that such medical expenses will be incurred in
the future.” Koenig v. Beekmans , 2017 WL 7732809, at *3
(W.D. Tex. Mar. 23, 2017). Thus, the standard for calculating
past medical expenses is different than that for future medical
expenses. In Koenig, the defendants argued that the plaintiff's
expert did not consult with the plaintiff's medical providers,
but instead used a database “to establish projected medical
costs.” Id. The court there rejected this as a basis for striking
the expert, as the plaintiff had evidence that the expert's
methodology in calculating the future costs was “sound.” Id.
*6  Here, Dr. Marcetti did use Hanan's select providers in
calculating future medical expenses. See Doc. 68, Pl.’s App.
Ex., C. (Marcetti Report), 6–12. And Dr. Marcetti identified
the sources from which he obtained the predicted medical
costs. See, e.g., id. at 30–32 (calculating the average cost of
various medications in the Dallas area); cf. Albert ex. rel Doe
v. U.S. Dep't of the Army , 2019 WL 5783420, at *3 (W.D.
Tex. Nov. 5, 2019)  (striking part of the expert's testimony
on future medical costs because the expert failed to identify
the “sources regarding costs associated with other [anticipated
future] treatments”).
Defendants’ issue is with how Dr. Marcetti used Hanan's
select providers in calculating her medical expenses. This
argument goes to the weight, not the admissibility, of Dr.
Marcetti's testimony. See Koenig, 2017 WL 7732809, at *3
(rejecting the motion to strike because “[w]hether or not
the estimate costs of future medical care are made based
on [local] rates goes to the weight not the admissibility of
the testimony” ). Defendants’ reply proves as much: they
believe that the Medicare and other factors should have been
considered by Dr. Marcetti. Doc. 78, Defs.’ Reply, 4. But,
“[a]s a general rule, questions relating to the bases and sources
of an expert's opinion affect the weight of the evidence rather
than its admissibility, and should be left for the finder of fact.”
Koenig, 2017 WL 7732809, at *3.
Thus, the Court DENIES Defendants’ motion to exclude Dr.
Marcetti's testimony (Doc. 56).
IV .
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ motion to strike the
testimony of Mr. Guntharp (Doc. 53) is GRANTED in
part and DENIED in part . The parts of Mr. Guntharp's
report that opine on Defendant Knapp's state of mind and
whether his actions were the cause of the accident are
STRICKEN. Additionally, conclusions (1) and (5) are also
STRICKEN. However, the Court DENIES the motion to
strike Mr. Guntharp's report as it relates to Defendant Knapp's
noncompliance with commercial safety standards. It is further
ORDERED that Defendants’ motion to strike the testimony
of Dr. Marcetti (Doc. 56) is DENIED.
SO ORDERED.
