MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
JANE J. BOYLE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
*1  Before the Court is Defendants JetPay, LLC's and
Trent R. V oigt's Motion to Strike Plaintiff's Expert Reports
and Exclude Testimony of Plaintiff's Expert Witnesses J.
Larry Daniels and Donald R. Smith (Doc. 190) [hereinafter
Defendants' Motion]. For the following reasons, the Court
GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Defendants' Motion.
I.
BACKGROUND
A. Expert Witness J. Larry Daniels
On June 11, 2013, the Court entered a scheduling order that
set deadlines for expert designations, expert reports, rebuttal
designations, and rebuttal reports. Doc. 22, Scheduling Order
1–3. In accordance with the scheduling order, Plaintiff BCC
Merchant Solutions, Inc. (BCC) provided a Preliminary
Expert Disclosure Statement that designated numerous
expert witnesses, including Donald R. Smith (Smith). Doc.
191-3, Defs.' App. 10. BCC, however, did not provide
retained expert witness reports. Because of this, Defendants
moved to exclude the testimony of BCC's expert witnesses.
Doc. 75. 1 The Court referred the motion to the magistrate
judge who denied it and ordered BCC to submit its expert
reports by November 10, 2014. Doc. 121, Order 8.
As ordered, BCC timely submitted its expert reports,
including the Expert Witness Report of J. Larry Daniels &
Donald R. Smith (the November Report). Doc. 191-4, Defs.'
App. 13. Though BCC had not previously designated J. Larry
Daniels (Daniels) as an expert witness, it listed him as a
damages expert in the November Report. Doc. 191-4, Defs.'
App. 13. To make the designation official, BCC provided a
Supplemental Rule 26(e) Disclosure on December 5, 2014
(the December Amendment). Doc. 191-5, Defs.' App. 24.
Defendants move to strike Daniels as an expert witness
because BCC did not designate him by the original scheduling
order's deadline, March 17, 2014. See Doc. 22. In response,
BCC explains that “between his designation and November
10, 2014, Mr. Smith began treatments for cancer.” Doc 208,
Pl.'s Resp. 2. Because BCC anticipated Smith's treatments
might preclude him from testifying at deposition or at trial,
it brought Daniels in to help prepare the November Report.
Id. at 2–3. BCC takes the position that the November
Report disclosed Daniels as an expert, and that the December
Amendment's official designation served as a mere formality.
Id. at 3. In the months following the December Amendment,
Smith withdrew as a testifying expert, and BCC de-designated
him. Id. (citing Doc. 209, Pl.'s App. 1–2).
B. The March Report
In the November Report, Smith and Daniels approximated
BCC's damages to be between $1,700,000 and $2,200,000
by comparing the valuation of BCC's merchant portfolio
before and after its conversion to JetPay's processing
platform.2 Doc. 191-4, Defs.' App. 15. On December 30,
2015, Defendants provided their Designation of Expert
Witnesses and Supplemental Disclosures, which included the
designation and expert report of Peter Davidson (Davidson)
who contested the November Report for: (1) not providing
individual merchant detail sufficient to know “why each
merchant actually left,” which “is necessary to ascertain
the true decrease, if any, in the value of BCC's [merchant]
portfolio”; and (2) addressing lost value rather than lost

profits.3 See Doc. 208, Pl.'s Resp. 3 (citing Doc. 191-6, Defs.'
App. 40, Davidson's Expert Report). Three months later, on
March 30, 2015, BCC served an Amended Expert Witness
Report of J. Larry Daniels (the March Report). Doc. 191-7,
Defs.' App. 84. This report appears to have been aimed at
addressing these two deficiencies by incorporating merchant-
level data taken from a survey conducted in January 2015
(the January Survey), and by examining merchant and agent
attrition to calculate lost profits. See id., Defs.' App. 89.
*2  Defendants move to strike the March Report because
of its late timing and prejudicial nature. Doc. 191-1, Br. in
Supp. 7. BCC served the report months after the November
10 expert reports deadline, 4 and, according to Defendants,
after they had conducted significant “discovery, investigation,
research, and depositions” based on the November Report.
Id. at 7–8. Specifically, eight depositions occurred between
the November Report and March Report, including the
deposition of BCC's CEO and designated 30(b)(6) corporate
representative Richard Noble. Id. at 6–7 (chart); 5 see also
Doc. 191-9, Defs.' App. 97, Dep. of Richard William Noble.
Additionally, Defendants claim to have made numerous
strategic decisions based upon BCC's November Report:
[D]ecisions were made regarding which witnesses to
depose and not depose and what questions to ask the
witnesses who were deposed. Defendants made decisions
regarding whether to depose merchants regarding the
damages sought based on the opinions and basis in
Plaintiff's original expert report. Also, decisions were made
regarding Defendants' decision to hire certain experts to
rebut Plaintiff's contentions regarding damages.
Doc. 191-1, Br. in Supp. 8.
BCC counters that the March Report, though styled as an
“Amended” report, “is more properly characterized as a
supplemental report or sur-rebuttal.” Doc. 208, Pl.'s Resp.
4. It argues that the March Report either supplements the
November Report by “incorporating results of the recent
surveys,” or rebuts Davidson's Expert Report by tackling
head-on the issue of lost profits. Id. Additionally, BCC
maintains that it has attempted to mitigate any prejudice to
Defendants “by offering to re-submit its Rule 30(b)(6) witness
[Richard Noble] (at Plaintiff's cost).” Id. at 5. Defendants'
Motion is now ready for review.
II.
LEGAL STANDARD
A. Disclosure of Expert Testimony
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2)(A) , a party
who retains an expert to provide expert testimony in a case
must disclose the identity of the expert. This disclosure
must be accompanied by an expert report that contains:
(1) a complete statement of all opinions of the expert
and the reasons for them; (2) the facts or data the expert
considered in forming his opinions; (3) any exhibits he
used to summarize or support his opinions; (4) the expert's
qualifications including publications; (5) a list of other cases
the expert has provided expert testimony in during the
previous four years; and (6) a statement of the expert's
compensation in the instant case. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B)
(i)–(vi).
Generally, a party designates its experts and discloses its
expert reports “at the times and in the sequence that the
court orders.” See id. 26(a)(2)(D). This includes designating
rebuttal experts and disclosing rebuttal reports intended solely
to contradict or rebut evidence in another party's expert
reports. “Absent a stipulation or a court order,” rebuttal
reports must be disclosed within thirty days of the other
party's disclosure of expert testimony. Id. 26(a)(2)(D)(ii).
However, Rule 26 does not address the availability and timing
of sur-rebuttal reports. “The Rule does not grant any right
to rebuttal beyond that initial rebuttal report.” La. Health
Care Self Ins. Fund v. United States , CIV .A. 12-766, 2014
WL 3720526, at *1 (M.D. La. July 25, 2014) . But it also
does not “prohibit the filing of sur-rebuttal reports. Instead, a
party wishing to provide a sur-rebuttal must first seek leave
of Court.” Id. (collecting cases).
*3  Additionally, a party must supplement a disclosure
pursuant to Rule 26(e) if (1) “the party learns in some material
respect the disclosure ... is incomplete or incorrect,” and
(2) “additional or corrective information has not otherwise
been made known to the other parties during the discovery
process or in writing,” id. 26(e)(1)(A), by the time pretrial
disclosures are due. Id. 26(e)(2). This is a duty to supplement
disclosures discovered to be incomplete or incorrect, not an
opportunity to provide information previously omitted. See
Sierra Club, Lone Star Chapter v. Cedar Point Oil Co. Inc. ,
73 F.3d 546, 571 (5th Cir. 1996)  (“The purpose of rebuttal
and supplementary disclosures is just that—to rebut and to
supplement. These disclosures are not intended to provide an

extension of the deadline by which a party must deliver the
lion's share of its expert information.”).
B. Failure to Properly Disclose
If a party fails to provide information as required under Rule
26(a) or (e) , he may not use that information or witness to
“supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless
the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.” Fed. R.
Civ. P. 37(c)(1). The Court has broad discretion in deciding
whether a Rule 26(a)  violation is substantially justified or
harmless. United States v. $9,041,598.68, 163 F.3d 238, 252
(5th Cir. 1998); see also Wilson v. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc. ,
3:12-CV-5292, 2014 WL 1882024, at *2–3 (N.D. Tex. May
12, 2014) (Boyle, J.). In exercising this discretion, the Court
considers four factors: (1) the reason for the failure to properly
disclose; (2) the importance of the disclosure; (3) the potential
prejudice in allowing the disclosure; and (4) the availability
of a continuance to cure such prejudice. See Betzel v. State
Farm Lloyds, 480 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir. 2007); Sierra Club,
Lone Star Chapter, 73 F.3d at 572.
III.
ANALYSIS
The Court now considers whether to exclude J. Larry
Daniels's expert testimony or strike his March Report.
For each, the Court must determine whether BCC actually
violated Rule 26 , and if so, whether the violation
was substantially justified or harmless under the Sierra
Club/Betzel factors. See Betzel, 480 F.3d at 707; Sierra Club,
Lone Star Chapter, 73 F.3d at 569.
A. Expert Witness J. Larry Daniels
BCC's late designation of J. Larry Daniels was clearly
untimely and in violation of Rule 26, but after considering the
Sierra Club/Betzel factors, the Court finds that the violation
was substantially justified or harmless. First, BCC provides
an explanation for its failure to identify the expert within the
designated timetable: it brought Daniels in to help prepare the
November Report because Smith, its previously-designated
damages expert, began cancer treatments. As it became clear
he could not proceed, BCC de-designated Smith and replaced
him with Daniels. This explanation provides a reasonable
justification for BCC's actions.
Second, once BCC de-designated Smith, Daniels became its
only damages expert able to speak to the November Report.
The parties agree that the issue of damages is extremely
important in this case, and that establishing damages will
require expert testimony. See Betzel, 480 F.3d at 707 (finding
expert testimony to be essential when plaintiff could not
prove damages without it). This means Daniels's testimony
has significant importance, which supports not excluding it.
Additionally, there is no indication that Defendants suffered
any prejudice by the late designation because BCC gave
notice of its intent to proffer Daniels as a damages expert
by listing him in the November Report, which was timely
disclosed. Even so, any possible prejudice can be cured
by allowing Defendants time to depose Daniels. “[A]
continuance is the preferred means of dealing with a party's
attempt to designate a witness out of time.” Id. at 708 (internal
quotation marks omitted) (quoting Campbell v. Keystone
Aerial Surveys, Inc. , 138 F.3d 996, 1000 (5th Cir. 1998) ).6
Here, Defendants have known for some time that BCC
intended to present Daniels's expert testimony at trial. If
they have not already taken his deposition, see Doc. 299,
Final Pre-Trial Materials 19, ¶ 24(iii) (“Mr. Daniels has not
been deposed in this case.”), they may request a continuance
to do so; however, they should be able to coordinate with
BCC on a time and place to take Daniels's deposition before
pretrial disclosures are due (April 8, 2016) without need for
a continuance. Therefore, the Court finds no basis to exclude
his testimony.
B. The March Report
*4  Whether BCC's untimely disclosure of the March Report
violated Rule 26 depends on if the Court considers the report
an amended, supplemental, or sur-rebuttal report. Defendants
argue that it is an amended report. This would mean BCC
disclosed it more than four months late, clearly in violation of
the Rule. BCC urges the Court to consider it a supplemental or
sur-rebuttal report. As a supplemental report BCC could have
disclosed it up until the time for pretrial disclosures without
violating Rule 26. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e)(2). And as a sur-
rebuttal report BCC could have disclosed it if it first sought
leave of the court. La. Health Care Self Ins. Fund, 2014 WL
3720526, at *1 (“[A] party wishing to provide a sur-rebuttal
must first seek leave of Court.”).
The March Report is not a supplemental report. Rule 26(e)
creates a duty to supplement when a party discovers some
material aspect of a previous disclosure is incomplete or

incorrect and other parties are not privy to the additional or
corrective information. It is not an opportunity for a party
to circumvent the Rule 26 requirement that an expert report
contain “a complete statement of all opinions the witness
will express and the basis and reasons for them.” Fed. R.
Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B)(i) (emphasis added); Sierra Club, Lone
Star Chapter , 73 F.3d at 571 . Here, the November Report
calculated lost value but did not provide individual merchant
data to substantiate its calculations. BCC appears to have
treated this lack of detail as an incomplete aspect of its original
report that the March Report supplements with an analysis of
the January Survey. This analysis, however, does not seem
like a necessary supplement as BCC provided it to bolster
weaknesses in the November Report in response to criticisms
from Davidson's Expert Report. Even assuming the survey
created a duty to supplement, it would have been sufficient to
turn over the information from the survey itself to Defendants.
From this, the Court concludes that the March Report goes
well beyond supplementation, and cannot be disclosed under
Rule 26(e).
So at best, the March Report is a sur-rebuttal report. As
such, it was improperly disclosed because BCC did not seek
leave to serve the March Report. Doc. 208, Pl.'s Resp. 9
(“Perhaps, it might have been more appropriate for Plaintiff to
seek leave to serve the March Report.”); see also La. Health
Care Self Ins. Fund, 2014 WL 3720526, at *1 . Thus, BCC's
disclosure of the March Report was either untimely (if treated
as an amended report) or improper (if treated as a sur-rebuttal
report). Therefore, it disclosure violated Rule 26.
After considering the Sierra Club /Betzel factors, the Court
concludes that the violation was neither substantially justified
nor harmless. First, BCC's reason for its untimely disclosure
was because “the report [wa]s directed to Defendants' own
rebuttal reports.” Doc. 208, Pl.'s Resp 10. BCC argues that
“the fact that the March Report (in part) [wa]s based on new
evidence obtained after receipt of those reports constitute
[sic] reasonable explanation for delay.” Id. This explanation
provides little justification. There is no right to a sur-rebuttal,
so this “delay” was unwarranted. See La. Health Care Self Ins.
Fund, 2014 WL 3720526, at *1 . Thus, this factor weighs in
favor of striking the March Report.
Second, the importance of the March Report is unclear. On
one hand, it expresses expert opinions on damages, and
expert testimony is necessary to establish BCC's damages.
This weighs against striking the report. See Betzel, 480 F.3d
at 708  (holding that importance weighs against exclusion).
On the other hand, BCC should have provided a “complete
statement of all opinions the witness will express and the
basis and reasons for them” for such an important report
instead of disclosing a second report with different opinions
and underlying bases. 7 Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B)(i) . This
weighs in favor of striking the report. See Barrett v. Atl.
Richfield Co. , 95 F.3d 375, 381 (5th Cir. 1996)  (“[T]he
claimed importance of Plaintiffs' expert testimony merely
underscores the need for Plaintiffs to have complied with the
court's deadlines.”); Geiserman v. MacDonald, 893 F.2d 787,
791 (5th Cir. 1990)  (assuming testimony was important to
“case—so much the more reason to be sure its introduction
was properly grounded”). Thus, the Court will treat this factor
as neutral.
*5  Third, the potential prejudice here is immense. “The
purpose of the requirement to exchange expert reports is to
eliminate unfair surprise to the opposing party and to conserve
resources.” Boudreaux v. J.P . Morgan Chase & Co., CIV .A.
07-555, 2007 WL 4162908, at *3 (E.D. La. Nov. 21, 2007) .
Defendants have been deprived of an opportunity to depose
Richard Noble, as well as four other relevant witnesses, on the
topic of BCC's new damages theory, and to rebut the March
Report with their own experts.
Fourth, a continuance would not cure the potential prejudice.
Essentially, Defendants were unfairly surprised in a way
that will prejudice them either strategically or monetarily.
Even though BCC has offered (at its own expense) to allow
Defendants to re-depose Richard Noble, it cannot provide
for the possible strategic advantages they might have gained
by deposing other witnesses on the topic or by selecting
different rebuttal experts. And if Defendants attempt to gain
this strategic advantage, they will bear the cost of additional
depositions and possibly additional expert costs. Either way, a
continuance will not cure the prejudice. Therefore, the Court
finds that BCC's disclosure of the March Report violated
Rule 26 and was neither substantially justified nor harmless.
Accordingly, the Court STRIKES the March Report.8
C. Daubert Hearing
Defendants also request that the Court conduct a Daubert
hearing to establish that Daniels's “proffered expert opinions
are relevant, reliable, and helpful.” Doc. 191-1, Br. in Supp.
23. The Court agrees that a hearing on Defendants' Daubert
motion is appropriate. It will hold the hearing as part of the
pre-trial conference. At the hearing, lead counsel must be
prepared to discuss their respective positions regarding the

motion. Any exhibits that may be used at the hearing, and
lists of witnesses that may be called, must be exchanged with
opposing counsel at least three days before the hearing. Each
side will have sixty (60) minutes to argue their positions on
the motion.
IV .
CONCLUSION
For these reasons, Defendants JetPay, LLC's and Trent R.
V oigt's Motion to Strike Plaintiff's Expert Reports and
Exclude Testimony of Plaintiff's Expert Witnesses J. Larry
Daniels and Donald R. Smith (Doc. 190) is GRANTED
in part  and DENIED in part . The Court STRIKES
the Amended Expert Witness Report of J. Larry Daniels
(i.e., the March Report) but does not exclude Daniels as
an expert witness. Daniels may testify concerning the
November Report, and Defendants may depose him about it.
Additionally, the Court GRANTS Defendants' request for a
Daubert hearing.

1 Rule 26(a)(2) requires expert disclosures to include retained expert witness reports.
2 For a detailed recount of the facts of the underlying case, see Doc. 279, Mem. Op. and Order. 2–3.
3 Defendants draw the distinction between lost value and lost profits to undercut BCC's damages theory. See Doc 191-1,
Br. in Supp. 10. Davidson's Expert Report asserts that the November Report's lost value calculations do not provide
sufficiently granular detail to determine actual lost profits. See Doc. 191-6, Defs.' App. 40. And BCC's counsel stated
during the deposition of Richard Noble that it seeks lost profits damages. Doc. 191-9, Defs.' App. 111–12, Dep. of Richard
William Noble 106:25–107:20. From this, the argument goes that while BCC requests damages specifically for lost profits,
the November Report does not address lost profits, meaning BCC's expert cannot testify to lost profits at trial. Without
this testimony, BCC cannot prove damages.
This argument is incorrect. It assumes that establishing lost value does not demonstrate lost profits. Having considered the
November Report, the Court concludes that lost value, from a macro perspective, represents lost profits. So establishing
the former demonstrates the latter, at least to some degree. It is unnecessary for the Court to determine the amount
of lost value or to what degree lost value translates to lost profits; those are questions best left for the trier of fact. It is
enough that the Court concludes there is some connection between the two.
4 Defendants also point out that BCC served the March Report the day before the dispositive motion deadline. As Court
has already ruled on summary judgment, it will not address this aspect of Defendants' Motion.
5 Other individuals deposed include: (1) Shivron Enjeti, JetPay Chief Technical Officer; (2) Aliki Liadis-Hall, former JetPay
employee; (3) Dave Chester, JetPay Chief Operational Officer; and (4) Trent R. Voigt, JetPay CEO, 30(b)(6) corporate
representative, and expert witness. Three Merrick Bank witnesses also were deposed, but as Merrick is no longer part
of this litigation, these depositions have little relevance.
6 In Betzel the Fifth Circuit held that “[a] continuance would have given State Farm an opportunity to [1] depose Matlock
and Frantz as expert witnesses, [2] to file Daubert challenges, and [3] to designate experts for rebuttal.” The main
purpose of a continuance in this case would be to allow for Defendants to depose Daniels. Defendants have already filed
a Daubert challenge against him, and were able to designate experts to rebut his November Report.
7 The March Report appears to change BCC's damages theory and to rely on a completely different set of information.
Compare  the November Report, Doc. 191-4, Defs.' App. 20 (analyzing lost value, relying on processor data and files to
calculate transactional net income), with the March Report, Doc. 191-7, Defs.' App. 88–89 (analyzing lost profits as a result

of lost merchant sales and sales agent attrition, relying directly on previously unknown or unincorporated information
like the January Survey).
8 The availability of the November Report mitigates the harshness of striking the March Report.
