ORDER ADOPTING SPECIAL MASTER'S REPORT
AND RECOMMENDATION
JANE J. BOYLE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
*1  On June 28, 2017, the Court appointed, pursuant to
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 53 , retired United States
Magistrate Judge Jeff Kaplan as the Special Master in this
case. Doc. 281, Order Appointing Special Master. On July
3, 2018, Judge Kaplan issued a report and recommendation
on the parties' motions to exclude the testimony of certain
expert witnesses. Doc. 521, Notice of R&R.
Having reviewed Judge Kaplan’s Report and
Recommendation, the parties' objections to the report, and
responses to those objections, the Court ADOPTS Judge
Kaplan’s report except as follows.
First, the plaintiffs moved to exclude Lawrence Ranallo’s
testimony. They argued that the Court should exclude
Ranallo’s testimony in part because Ranallo did not disclose
that Price Waterhouse Coopers (PWC) employees helped him
to prepare his expert report. But the plaintiffs did not make
this argument until their reply in support of their motion to
exclude. Because the plaintiffs raised the argument only in
their reply, Judge Kaplan declined to rule on it. Now, the
plaintiffs say they raised the argument as soon as they could,
and they contend that Judge Kaplan should have considered
their argument or that the argument is properly before the
Court anyways. The Court declines at this time to decide
whether to exclude Ranallo’s testimony based on his alleged
failure to disclose PWC’s work on his expert report but will
rule on the admissibility of Ranallo’s testimony at the pretrial
conference. The Court directs the defendants to supplement
their response to the plaintiffs' objection to Judge Kaplan’s
report and recommendation with briefing responding to the
plaintiffs' argument that the Court should exclude Ranallo’s
testimony because of his failure to disclose the work that
PWC performed on his report. The defendants should file
this briefing by 5:00pm on Wednesday, July 25.
Second, the defendants moved to exclude the testimony of
Lori Jones, Herjit Pannu, and Robert Newman. Judge Kaplan
recommended that the Court deny the defendants' motion
but ordered the plaintiffs to supplement their disclosures of
these experts' opinions and allowed the defendants to depose
Lori Jones again. Even after the supplemental disclosures
and deposition, the defendants maintain that the Court should
prevent Jones, Pannu, and Newman from offering expert
opinions at trial. The Court continues to consider the briefing
on this argument, and though the Court declines to adopt
Judge Kaplan’s report and recommendation on Jones, Pannu,
and Newman at this time, the Court will decide whether to
exclude these witnesses' testimony at the pretrial conference.
Aside from those two exceptions: the court adopts in full
Judge Kaplan’s report and recommendation. The Court denies
the motions to exclude the testimony of:
