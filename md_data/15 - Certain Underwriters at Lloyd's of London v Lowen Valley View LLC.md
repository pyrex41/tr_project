MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
JANE J. BOYLE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
*1  Before the Court is Plaintiff Certain Underwriters
at Lloyd's of London, Syndicate Nos. 2003, 1414, 0510,
4472, 1183, 1200, and 4444, Subscribing to Policy Number
NJL440003612's (Plaintiff or Underwriters) Amended
Motion for Summary Judgment. Doc. 46. For the reasons
explained below, Plaintiff's Motion is GRANTED.
I.
BACKGROUND
A. Factual History1
This is an insurance coverage dispute involving hail damage
to a hotel. Defendants Lowen Valley View, LLC and Panade
II Ltd. d/b/a Hilton Garden Inn (collectively Defendants) own
and operate the Hilton Garden Inn in Irving, Texas. Doc.
34, Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. 4 [hereinafter Defs.'
Resp.]. Underwriters issued a standard commercial property
insurance policy (the Policy) to Defendants covering the hotel
for the period from June 2, 2012, to June 2, 2013. Doc. 47,
Pl.'s Br. in Supp. of Am. Mot. Summ. J. 2 [hereinafter Pl.'s
Br.]. The Policy, by its terms, covered “direct physical loss or
damage to Covered Property at the premises described in the
Declarations caused by or resulting from any Covered Cause
of Loss.” Id. (referencing Doc. 48, Pl.'s App. in Supp. of Am.
Mot. Summ. J. [hereinafter Pl.'s App.] 133, Ex. D, Building
and Personal Property Coverage Form). The parties do not
dispute that hail was a covered cause of loss under the Policy.
See Doc. 11, Defs.' Answer & Countercls. ¶ 26; see also Doc.
47, Pl.'s Br. 11.
In November 2014, Ajay Desai, the vice president of the
company that manages the hotel, was evaluating the property
for potential capital improvement projects. Doc. 34, Defs.'
Resp. 5. Noticing that “the shingles on the top of the hotel
looked bad,” Desai contacted a roofing contractor, who
inspected the property and found evidence of significant
hail damage to the various roofing systems at the property.
Id. On December 22, 2014, this roofing contractor obtained
a weather history report from a company called Weather
Fusion/Point Data, which noted several hail events at or near
the hotel between the dates of January 1, 2006, and December
21, 2014. Id. (citing Doc. 48, Pl.'s App. 209–11, Ex. G,
Weather Fusion/PointData Report).2
Specifically, the report, dated December 22, 2014, noted nine
events of hail “at location” between January 1, 2006, and
December 21, 2014, five of which had “estimated maximum
hail size” of greater than one inch. See Doc. 48, Pl.'s App.
209–11, Ex. G, Weather Fusion/Point Data Report. Of the
nine hail events noted “at location,” seven occurred before the
policy period, one after, and one during, on June 13, 2012.
See id. The event with the largest “estimated maximum hail
size” noted “at location” was on May 24, 2011. See id. And
of the five events with “estimated maximum hail size” greater
than one inch, only the June 13, 2012 event occurred during
the policy period; the other four occurred prior to the policy
period. See id.
*2  Defendants' roofing contractor provided a copy of
the Weather Fusion/PointData report to Desai, who in
turn provided a copy to Defendants' insurance agent on
December 29, 2014. Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp. 5; Doc. 47, Pl.'s
Br. 3. Defendants' insurance agent filed a hail claim with

## Page 2

 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 2
Underwriters on behalf of Defendants on the same day. Doc.
34, Defs.' Resp. 5; Doc. 47, Pl.'s Br. 3. The description of the
damage provided to Underwriters was “roof damage due to
hail,” and the date of loss listed on the Property Loss Notice
was June 13, 2012, the date of the only hail event noted on the
Weather Fusion/PointData report provided to the insurance
agent that occurred during the policy period. Doc. 48, Pl.'s
App. 204–05, Ex. E, Property Loss Notice.
After receiving notice of the claim from the agent,
Underwriters assigned the investigation of the claim to
Frontier Adjusters, which sent an independent adjuster, Derek
Phipps, to inspect the property for hail damage in mid-January
2015. Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp. 5; Doc. 47, Pl.'s Br. 4; Doc. 48,
Pl.'s App. 231–38, Ex. J, Phipps Damage Estimate. 3 When
assigned the job, Phipps received only the Property Loss
Notice, which included no information about the Policy or
its coverage and no special instructions for the inspection.
Doc. 48, Pl.'s App. 205, Ex. E, Property Loss Notice; Doc.
33, Defs.' App. in Supp. of Resp. to Pl.'s Am. Mot. Summ. J.
[hereinafter Defs.' App.] 52–55, Ex. D, Dep. of Derek Phipps.
Before physically inspecting the property, Phipps consulted
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
reports online, which he used to confirm that a hail storm had
in fact occurred in the area and on the date of loss provided
to him by Frontier Adjusters. Doc. 33, Defs.' App. 65–66,
Ex. D, Dep. of Derek Phipps. Phipps's computer log notes
from January 16, 2015, indicate that he found significant hail
damage to the roofs and exterior siding upon inspection of
the property. Id. at 412, Ex. K, Phipps Computer Log Notes.
Phipps determined that the roofs would require replacement
rather than repair, and on January 19, 2015, prepared an
estimate of what it would cost to replace the roofs. Doc. 48,
Pl.'s App. 231–38, Ex. J, Phipps Damage Estimate. 4 Phipps
submitted his estimate to Frontier Adjusters through a web-
based computer program. Doc. 33, Defs.' App. 73, Ex. D,
Dep. of Derek Phipps.
*3  On March 2, 2015, Underwriters—through an authorized
claims administrator, Peninsula Insurance Bureau—sent a
“reservation of rights” letter to Defendants, which indicated
that the initial investigation had revealed “potential coverage
issues,” namely “late reporting of the loss.” Id. at 239–42, Ex.
K, Reservation of Rights Letter. Therefore, the letter stated,
the investigation would proceed “under a full reservation of
rights.” Id. It also directed Defendants to the specific policy
language requiring “prompt notice of the loss or damage.”
Id. (quoting Doc. 48, Pl.'s App. 35, Building and Personal
Property Coverage Form, Part E.3.a.2). Finally, the letter
noted that “any recommendations made by the adjuster [were]
subject to the Underwriters' review and approval.” Id. at 242.
Subsequently, Underwriters—through Frontier Adjusters—
engaged a company called Haag Engineering to “determine
the extent of hailstone impact damage to the roofing and
siding” and to “evaluate when hail damage might have
occurred.” Doc. 33, Defs.' App. 243, Ex. G, Haag Report No.
1. Haag's first report, dated April 8, 2015, noted that “[a] date
of June 13, 2012 was provided with our assignment.”  Id. at
244. After inspecting the property on March 17, 2015, and
consulting weather history reports from the National Climatic
Data Center, CoreLogic (formerly Weather Fusion, the same
company that provided the initial weather history reports to
Defendants' roofing contractor), and NOAA, Haag concluded
that “the most recent hailstorm with hailstones large enough
to cause the damage we observed was on June 13, 2012.” Id. at
250 (emphasis added). Notably, the CoreLogic report attached
to Haag's report contained the same history of hail events
found in the Weather Fusion/PointData report provided to
Desai and Defendants' insurance agent prior to the filing of the
claim. Compare Doc. 48, Pl.'s App. 209–11, Ex. G, Weather
Fusion/PointData Report (provided to Desai and insurance
agent), with Doc. 33, Defs.' App. 263–64, Ex. G, Haag Report
No. 1 (CoreLogic report attached to Haag Report No. 1).
A second report from Haag Engineering, ordered specifically
to “discuss the likelihood that damage occurred between
December 29, 2012 and December 29, 2014,” again noted
that Haag had “no reason to believe the dents occurred more
recently than the June 13, 2012 date given.” Id. at 363–64, Ex.
H, Haag Report No. 2 (emphasis added). This report also for
the first time identified “June 13, 2012 as the most likely date
damage occurred.” Id. at 363 (emphasis added). As discussed
below, Defendants place much weight on this slight change
in wording.
In December 2015, Underwriters requested an Examination
Under Oath of Ajay Desai, vice president of the hotel's
property management company. Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp. 8.
The Examination took place in January 2016. There, Desai
described how he first noticed the condition of the roofs
in November 2014 and how he sent the Weather Fusion/
PointData report to the insurance agent, who Desai suspected
then chose the date of loss to report to the insurer. See
generally Doc. 33, Defs.' App. Ex. C, Exam. Under Oath of
Ajay Desai; see also Doc. 48, Pl.'s App. 208, Ex. F, Exam.
Under Oath of Ajay Desai (“I think they looked at the history

and they probably saw which period had the highest amount
of hail and—I assume that's how they determined where to
file the claim.”).
A month later, on February 18, 2016, Underwriters denied
Defendants' claim “based on [Defendants'] failure to give
timely notice.” Doc. 48, Pl.'s App. 246–49, Ex. M, Denial
Letter. The Denial Letter again directed Defendants to
the “prompt notice” requirement in the Policy and stated
that Defendants “failed to give notice of the damage to
the Property until over two and a half years after the
alleged hailstorm.” Id. at 248. The Letter indicated that this
“late notice has prejudiced Underwriters' ability to properly
investigate the claim and pay only for damage that occurred
during the policy period.” Id. at 249.
B. Procedural History
*4  On the same day, February 18, 2016, Underwriters also
filed its Original Complaint and Request for Declaratory
Judgment, asking the Court to declare “that there is no
coverage under [the Policy] for the reported hail damage
because Defendants violated the policy's notice condition and
Underwriters suffered prejudice as a result.” Doc. 1, Pl.'s
Original Compl. & Req. for Declaratory J. ¶ 21. Defendants
later counterclaimed for declaratory judgment, breach of the
insurance contract, and multiple violations of §§ 541 and
542 of the Texas Insurance Code. Doc. 11, Defs.' Answer &
Countercls.5
Underwriters now moves for summary judgment on
Defendants' breach of contract and Texas Insurance Code
counterclaims. Doc. 46, Pl.'s Am. Mot. Summ. J [hereinafter
Pl.'s Mot.].6 Defendants responded (Doc. 32), and Plaintiff
replied (Doc. 43).7 Therefore, Plaintiff's Motion is now ripe
for review.
II.
LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment is appropriate “if the movant shows that
there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the
movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ.
P. 56(a). A dispute “is ‘genuine’ if the evidence is sufficient
for a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the non-moving
party.” Burrell v. Dr. Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Grp. , 482
F.3d 408, 411 (5th Cir. 2007). And a fact “is ‘material’ if its
resolution could affect the outcome of the action.” Id.
*5  The summary judgment movant bears the burden
of proving that no genuine issue of material fact exists.
Latimer v. Smithkline & French Labs. , 919 F.2d 301,
303 (5th Cir. 1990) . Usually, this requires the movant to
identify “those portions of the pleadings, depositions, answers
to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with
affidavits, if any, which it believes demonstrate the absence
of a genuine issue of material fact.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,
477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted).
But if the non-movant ultimately bears the burden of proof at
trial, the movant may satisfy its burden just by pointing to the
absence of evidence supporting the non-movant's case. Id. at
322–23.
If the movant meets that burden, then it falls to the non-
movant to “show with significant probative evidence that
there exists a genuine issue of material fact.” Hamilton v.
Segue Software Inc. , 232 F.3d 473, 477 (5th Cir. 2000)
(internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Conkling v. Turner,
18 F.3d 1285, 1295 (5th Cir. 1994)). And significant probative
evidence is just that: significant. See Little v. Liquid Air
Corp., 37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir. 1994)  (per curiam).
“[M]etaphysical doubt as to material facts,” “conclusory
allegations,” “unsubstantiated assertions,” or a mere “scintilla
of evidence” will not do. Id.(internal citations and quotation
marks omitted). Rather, “the non-movant must go beyond the
pleadings and present specific facts indicating a genuine issue
for trial.” Bluebonnet Hotel Ventures, L.L.C. v. Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A., 754 F.3d 272, 276 (5th Cir. 2014) (citing Celotex,
477 U.S. at 324).
To be sure, the court views evidence in the light most
favorable to the non-movant when determining whether a
genuine issue exists. Munoz v. Orr, 200 F.3d 291, 302 (5th
Cir. 2000). But it need not “sift through the record in search
of evidence to support a party's opposition to summary
judgment.” Ragas v. Tenn. Gas Pipeline Co. , 136 F.3d 455,
458 (5th Cir. 1998) (quoting Skotak v. Tenneco Resins, Inc.,
953 F.2d 909, 915–16 & n.7 (5th Cir. 1992)). Simply put, the
non-movant must “identify specific evidence in the record”
and “articulate the precise manner in which that evidence
supports [its] claim.” Id. If it cannot, then the court must grant
summary judgment. Little, 37 F.3d at 1076.

III.
ANALYSIS
A. Defendants' Evidentiary Objections
Before turning to the merits of Plaintiff's Motion,
the Court must first address Defendants' objections to
Plaintiff's summary judgment evidence. Defendants object to
paragraphs 10, 11, 12, 13, and 16 of the affidavit of Derek
Phipps, which is attached as Exhibit H to Plaintiff's Amended
Motion for Summary Judgment. Doc. 35, Defs.' Objs. to Pl.'s
Evid. in Supp. of Summ. J. [hereinafter Defs.' Objs.].
As noted above, Phipps was the independent adjuster
sent by Frontier Adjusters—on behalf of Underwriters—to
investigate the property a few weeks after the hail claim was
filed. Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp. 5; Doc. 47, Pl.'s Br. 4. Plaintiff
provided an affidavit from Phipps as part of its summary
judgment evidence. See Doc. 48, Pl.'s App. 212–15, Ex. H,
Aff. of Derek Phipps. The affidavit is dated July 25, 2016
—roughly five months after the claim was denied and this
lawsuit was filed—and it describes generally how Phipps's
investigation was affected by the two and a half year gap
between the time of the reported loss in June 2012 and the
filing and investigation of the claim in December 2014 and
January 2015. Id.
The entirety of the challenged portion of Phipps's affidavit
states the following:
10. “The late notice of the claim impacted the investigation
in the following ways:
*6  a. I was unable to inspect the insured property
immediately after the loss.
b. I was unable to document the condition of the roof
immediately following the Loss.
c. I was unable to determine if the roof or exterior
elevations had been impacted by other weather events or
other non-covered perils preceding the Loss.
d. I lost the opportunity to quantify the damage present
at the insured premises immediately after the Loss.
e. I lost the opportunity to interview witnesses who
may have known the prior condition of the roof and the
impact of the Loss.
f. The condition of the roofs changed significantly
between the time of the alleged hail storm and the
date notice was finally given, making investigation of
the existence and extent of the related damage nearly
impossible.”
11. “As a result of the late notice of the claim, the
investigation was severely hindered.”
12. “As a result of the late notice of the claim, I could not
conduct a full and fair investigation of the circumstances
surrounding the Loss in order to determine whether the
damage resulted from a covered peril.”
13. “Based on the Xactimate pricing, the late notice of the
claim increased the estimated cost to repair the damage to
the Property.”
....
16. “Based on the Xactimate pricing, the estimated cost
to repair the damage to the Property increased during the
thirty-month delay in the reporting of the claim. The cost
to repair the damage to the Property would have been
$47,802.67 less if the claim was reported immediately
following the Loss.”
Id. ¶¶ 10–13, 16.
Defendants' objections to these paragraphs fall into two
categories. First, Defendants object to paragraphs 10, 11, and
12 because, Defendants argue, the statements are conclusory,
fall within the realm of expert testimony, and conflict with
Phipps's (later) deposition testimony. Doc. 35, Defs.' Objs.
2–5. Second, Defendants object to paragraphs 13 and 16
because, according to Defendants, “they mischaracterize facts
in evidence.” Id. at 5.
A lay witness's testimony is limited to that which is within his
“personal knowledge of the matter,” as required by Federal
Rule of Evidence 602. Fed. R. Evid. 602. Lay witness opinion
testimony is “limited to those opinions or inferences which
are (a) rationally based on the perception of the witness, (b)
helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' [sic] testimony
or the determination of a fact in issue, and (c) not based on
scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within
the scope of Rule 702.” United States v. Cooks, 589 F.3d 173,
179–80 (5th Cir. 2009)  (citing Fed. R. Evid. 701 ). “[T]he
distinction between lay and expert witness testimony is that
expert testimony results from a process of reasoning which
can be mastered only by specialists in the field.” United

## Page 5

Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London v. Lowen Valley..., Not Reported in Fed....
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 5
States v. Yanez Sosa , 513 F.3d 194, 200 (5th Cir. 2008) .
Lay testimony, on the other hand, “must be the product
of reasoning processes familiar to the average person in
everyday life.” Cooks, 589 F.3d at 180 (citing United States
v. Garcia, 413 F.3d 201, 215 (2d Cir. 2005)).
Looking first at the statements in paragraphs 10, 11, and
12, the Court disagrees with Defendants that the statements
are conclusory or within the realm of expert testimony.
With the exception of paragraph 10(f), the Court finds that
the statements are merely facts within Phipps's personal
knowledge or opinions rationally based upon his perception
of the facts. For example, it is a temporal fact that Phipps “was
unable to document the condition of the roof immediately
following the loss,” which necessarily impacted his ability to
investigate the “circumstances surrounding the Loss.” Doc.
48, Pl.'s App. 214, Ex. H., Aff. of Derek Phipps ¶¶ 10, 11, 12.
*7  Turning to paragraph 10(f), however, the Court agrees
with Defendants. Paragraph 10(f) states that the “condition
of the roofs changed significantly between the time of the
alleged hail storm and the date notice was finally given.” Id.
¶ 10(f). But the rest of Phipps's affidavit belies his personal
knowledge of the condition of the roofs at the time of the
June 2012 hail storm. Because Phipps was unable to inspect
the roofs immediately following the June 2012 storm, and
because he is not designated as a roofing expert in this
case, he cannot definitively state that these roofs “changed
significantly” during the time between the storm and his
inspection. Therefore, Defendants' objection is SUSTAINED
on this point and paragraph 10(f) is STRICKEN from the
record.
As for Defendants' argument that the remainder of paragraphs
10, 11, and 12 conflicts with Phipps's deposition testimony,
the Court is not convinced. The Court disagrees with
Defendants that Phipps's affidavit conflicts with his later-
given deposition testimony. Defendants argue that Phipps's
affidavit stating that his investigation was impaired by the
two-and-a-half-year lapse in time between the claimed date
of loss and the filing and investigation of the insurance claim
conflicts with his later-given deposition testimony that he was
able to provide a complete estimate of the cost to replace the
roofs in January 2015. Doc. 35, Defs.' Objs. 3–5.
Phipps's ability to provide an estimate of what it would cost to
repair the damage he observed does not speak to whether this
investigation was hampered in any way. See Hamilton Props.
v. Am. Ins. Co. , No. 3:12-CV-5046-B, 2014 WL 3055801,
at *10 (N.D. Tex. July 7, 2014)  (noting that “the ability to
conduct the investigation does not necessarily speak to the
investigation's quality”), aff'd, 643 Fed.Appx. 437 (5th Cir.
2016). Furthermore, the Court finds that Phipps's September
2016 deposition testimony is, in fact, quite consistent with his
previous affidavit. See, e.g., Doc. 33, Defs. App. 121–22, Ex.
D, Dep. of Derek Phipps (“Q: Would it be fair to say that the
more time passes after a hail event damages a property, the
harder it is to tell when that damage occurred? A: That's fair
to say. Q: Would it be fair to say that, if there are multiple
hail events that caused damage to the property, the more time
passes, the harder it would get to determine which damage
was incurred on which date? A: I would agree with that.”).
Turning to Defendants' objections to paragraphs 13 and 16,
the Court disagrees that these paragraphs mischaracterize any
facts in evidence. Defendants' objection centers on Phipps's
use of the Xactimate computer program to compare the cost
to replace the roofs in June 2012 versus the cost to replace
them two and a half years later in January 2015. According
to Plaintiff, Xactimate is a commonly used comprehensive
software solution allowing insurance companies to estimate
materials and labor prices for a specific time and place based
on a constantly updated database of prices. Doc. 47, Pl.'s
Br. 17; see also Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp. 10–11 (acknowledging
that “Xactimate is typically used in the insurance industry
to prepare estimates and provide the estimator with unit
costs from a particular area of the state or country and for a
particular time”).
Phipps used Xactimate to prepare an estimate following
his inspection in January 2015—using January 2015 pricing
—which came to $472,028.08. Doc. 48, Pl.'s App. 214,
Ex. H, Aff. of Derek Phipps ¶¶ 8–9. Phipps later ran the
numbers again using June 2012 pricing, which produced an
estimate of $424,225.41. Id. ¶ 15–16. So according to Phipps's
calculations, if Defendants had reported the damage in June
2012 immediately after the storm that allegedly caused it
instead of waiting until December 2014, then—assuming the
loss was covered—the cost to repair the damage in June 2012
would have been $47,802.67 less based on materials and labor
costs at that time. Id. ¶ 16. Thus, according to Phipps, “[b]ased
on the Xactimate pricing, the late notice of the claim increased
the estimated cost to repair the damage to the Property.” Id.
¶ 13.
*8  Defendants contend that “[t]he fact that the estimate
prepared using the January 2015 pricing was higher than
the estimate prepared using the June 2012 pricing does not

prove that the late notice of claim increased the estimated
cost to repair the damage to the Property, but rather proves
that Phipps could have utilized June 2012 pricing at any
time during his investigation.” Doc. 35, Defs.' Objs. 5. Put
differently, Defendants argue that merely plugging different
dates into a computer program does not demonstrate that the
two-and-a-half-year delay resulted in prejudice to Plaintiff.
But Defendants take no issue with Phipps's use of Xactimate
generally to estimate repair costs. Rather, they object to the
implications of his calculations. The affidavit merely states
that Xactimate comes up with one number using June 2012
pricing and another number using January 2015 pricing. The
Court fails to see how these statements regarding calculations
performed by Phipps mischaracterize any facts in evidence.
In conclusion, Defendants' objections to Plaintiff's summary
judgment evidence, namely paragraphs 10, 11, 12, 13, and
16 in the affidavit of Derek Phipps, are OVERRULED with
the exception of paragraph 10(f), which the Court STRIKES
from the record. The Court turns now to the merits of
Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment.
B. Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment
Underwriters moves for summary judgment on Defendants'
counterclaims for breach of contract and violation of the
Texas Insurance Code. The Court reviews each of Defendants'
counterclaims in turn below.
1. Defendants' Breach of Contract Counterclaim
Defendants contend that the damage to their property was
the result of a hail storm that occurred during the policy
period, and therefore Plaintiff breached the insurance contract
when it denied Defendants' claim. Doc. 11, Defs. Answer &
Countercls. ¶ 46.
Under Texas law, “[a]n insurance policy is a contract and is
therefore subject to rules of contract interpretation.” F .D.I.C.
v. Firemen's Ins. C. of Newark, N.J. , 109 F.3d 1084, 1087
(5th Cir. 1997)  (citing Forbau v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. , 876
S.W.2d 132, 133 (Tex. 1994) ). “The elements of a breach
of contract claim are: (1) the existence of a valid contract;
(2) performance tendered by [Defendants]; (3) breach of the
contract by [Underwriters]; and (4) damages to [Defendants]
resulting from that breach.” Wright v. Christian & Smith, 950
S.W.2d 411, 412 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1997, no
writ). Further, “Texas law clearly states that for an insurance
company to be liable for a breach of its duty to satisfy a
claim presented by its insured, the insured must prove that its
claim falls within the insuring agreement of the policy.” Data
Specialties, Inc. v. Transcontinental Ins. Co. , 125 F.3d 909,
911 (5th Cir. 1997). And “[t]he insured bears the initial burden
of showing that there is coverage....” Primrose Operating Co.
v. Nat'l Am. Ins. Co., 382 F.3d 546, 553 (5th Cir. 2004). That
is to say that for Underwriters to be liable for breach of the
insurance contract, Defendants must first prove that the claim
was covered under the Policy.
Underwriters argues two grounds for summary judgment on
Defendants' breach of contract counterclaim. First, Plaintiff
argues that Defendants cannot prove that the claimed damage
resulted from a covered peril because Defendants have
provided no evidence segregating the damage attributable
to the June 13, 2012 storm from damage attributable to the
various other storms documented as occurring outside of the
policy period in the years before and after the Policy was in
effect. Doc. 46, Pl.'s Mot. 1–2. Second, Plaintiff contends that
Defendants failed to comply with their duty under the Policy
to provide prompt notice of the loss, which Plaintiff argues
prejudiced its ability to investigate the claim and increased
the cost to replace the roofs. Id. at 2. The Court considers the
parties' arguments below.
i. Covered loss
“An insured cannot recover under an insurance policy unless
facts are pleaded and proved showing that damages are
covered by his policy.” Emp'rs Cas. Co. v. Block, 744 S.W.2d
940, 944 (Tex. 1988) , overruled in part on other grounds
by State Farm Fire & Cas. v. Gandy , 925 S.W.2d 696 (Tex.
1996). To be sure, an insured who suffers damage from both
covered and excluded perils is not precluded from recovering
for the covered loss, but “[w]hen covered and excluded perils
combine to cause an injury, the insured must present some
evidence affording the jury a reasonable basis on which to
allocate the damage.” Lyons v. Miller Cas. Ins. Co. of Tex., 866
S.W.2d 597, 601 (Tex. 1993) . “[T]he burden of segregating
the damage attributable solely to the covered event is a
coverage issue for which the insured carries the burden of
proof.” One Way Invs., Inc. v. Century Sur. Co. , No. 3:14-
CV-2839-D, 2016 WL 5122124, at *2 (N.D. Tex. Sept. 21,
2016) (citing Wallis v. United Servs. Auto. Ass'n , 2 S.W.3d
300, 303 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1999, pet. denied)). And
“[f]ailure to provide evidence upon which a jury or court can
allocate damages between those that resulted from covered
perils and those that did not is fatal to an insured party's

claim.” Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa. v. Puget
Plastics Corp., 735 F. Supp. 2d 650, 669 (S.D. Tex. 2010).
*9  Here, Underwriters concedes that “the Policy covers
damage by a windstorm or hail event which occurred during
the Policy period—June 2, 2012 to June 2, 2013.” Doc.
47, Pl.'s Br. 11. But it argues that Defendants have failed
to provide any evidence either that the present damage is
solely due to the June 13, 2012 storm or upon which a
jury could reasonably allocate the present damage between
the June 2012 storm and several documented hail events
occurring outside the coverage period. Id. at 11–12. In
support, Underwriters points to the fact that Defendants' own
weather history reports—provided first to Desai and then by
Desai to the insurance agent—show eight hail events outside
of the policy period that could have caused the damage. Id.
Plaintiff also notes that Defendants didn't even select the
date of loss for the insurance claim themselves; rather, the
insurance agent selected the date after reviewing the weather
reports and seeing that one hail event occurred during the
policy period. Id. at 12.
Rather than pointing to evidence upon which a jury could
reasonably allocate damages, Defendants instead focus on
their contention that “all of [sic] damage was from the
June 13, 2012 storm.” Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp. 13. In support,
Defendants contend that Underwriters “was in possession
of at least three documents establishing June 13, 2012 as
the date of loss when they made the decision to deny
Defendants' claim.” Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp. 2. The three
documents Defendants reference are the damage estimate and
related computer log notes of Derek Phipps and the first
and second reports prepared by Haag Engineering. Id. As
discussed below, however, neither these documents nor any
other evidence submitted by Defendants raise a genuine issue
of material fact as to whether the damage was entirely due to
the June 13, 2012 storm or from which a jury could reasonably
segregate the damages between storms.
Beginning with the Phipps Damage Estimate and related
computer log notes, Defendants contend that Phipps “had no
problem connecting the hail damage to the 2012 storm.” Doc.
34, Defs.' Resp. 6. For support, Defendants point to the fact
that Phipps's estimate lists “June 13, 2012” in the “Date of
Loss” field, and a computer log note by Phipps on January 16,
2015, states that “[t]he roof materials are totaled by hail on the
reported and documented DOL.” Id. Contrary to Defendants'
contention that Phipps tied the damage to the June 2012
storm, however, Phipps's deposition is replete with testimony
that he was not making any recommendations with regard
to coverage, but instead was hired merely to investigate the
extent of the damage and estimate the cost to repair or replace
the roofs. See, e.g., Doc. 33, Defs.' App. 44, Ex. D, Dep. of
Derek Phipps (“Q: .... And you also made a recommendation
to Frontier about coverage? A: No. Just documented the
damage and made recommendations for repairs.”); id. at 83
(“Q: And you made those recommendations from damage by
hail as a result of the June 13th, 2012 storm; correct? A: Due
to hail damage. Q: But specifically due to the June 13th, 2012
storm; correct? A: At that time I wasn't questioning the date
of loss.”); id. at 119 (“Q: And were you able to determine,
during your inspection, when the hail damage was caused?
A: That wasn't part of my inspection.”); id. at 120 (“Q: So it
was clear to you at the time that the damage that you saw was
caused by hail? A: Yes. Q: And you just weren't sure when it
was caused? A: Correct.”).
As for the notation of “June 13, 2012” as the “Date of Loss”
on the estimate and in the computer log notes, Phipps testified
that he was merely repeating the date of loss provided to him.
Id. at 81 (“A: I did reference the provided date of loss because
I wasn't questioning that at the time.”); id. at 102 (“Q: .... The
only storm that you identified anywhere in your estimate, your
notes, your reports was the June 13th, 2012 storm; true? A:
That's the date of loss I used, yes. Just to be clear, I wasn't
there to determine the date of loss.”); id. at 124 (“Q: .... Just
tell us what you meant by that note, please. A: I just meant
that the hail—date of loss that was reported, there was hail on
that date.”); id. (“A: I guess I was just reiterating that the—
the date of loss that they gave to me that we documented, that
there was hail on that date.”).
*10  Far from establishing that Phipps attributed the damage
solely to the June 13, 2012 storm, the evidence merely
demonstrates that there was hail damage observed at the
property as of January 2015 and that weather history reports
reviewed by Phipps as part of his inspection confirmed that a
storm had occurred at the location on June 13, 2012, neither
of which Plaintiff contests. Defendants' attempt to conjure a
causation opinion out of Phipps's parroting the date of loss
he'd received with his assignment is unconvincing. Thus,
Phipps's estimate and log notes do little more than support
a point that is not actually in dispute—that the June 13,
2012 storm could have  caused the damage. “Whether the
storm actually did—and to what extent—remains unclear.”
Hamilton, 2014 WL 30555801, at *5 (emphasis added).

Turning to the Haag reports, Defendants argue that “Haag
concluded in their April 8, 2015 report (Report No. 1) that the
hail damage to the hotel was from the June 13, 2012 storm.”
Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp. 7. What the first Haag report actually
states is that the June 13, 2012 storm was “the most recent
hailstorm with hailstones large enough to cause the damage.”
Doc. 33, Defs.' App. 250, Ex. G, Haag Report No. 1 (emphasis
added). As mentioned above, Haag had also reviewed—
and provided to Underwriters as an attachment to its first
report—the same Weather Fusion/PointData weather history
information showing four other hail events with estimated
maximum hail size of greater than one inch at the property
prior to the coverage period. Id. at 263–64.
As for the second Haag report, Defendants make much of
the following statement: “We considered other sources of
information and they helped us confirm June 13, 2012 as
the most likely date damage occurred.” Doc. 33, Defs.' App.
363, Ex. H, Haag Report No. 2 (emphasis added). This
statement is unsurprising, however, considering the context
of the second Haag report, which was specifically addressing
“the likelihood that damage occurred between December 29,
2012 and December 29, 2014,” the two-year period prior to
the date the claim was filed. See id. Significantly, a subsequent
Haag report confirmed that “[t]here have been multiple hail
events at this location.” Doc. 33, Defs.' App. 372, Ex. I, Haag
Report No. 3. This third report noted that “[h]ail as great
as 1.50-inch diameter hail was reported on March 10, 2010,
4.25-inch diameter hail on May 24, 2011, 2.75-inch diameter
hail on April 3, 2012 and 2.75-inch diameter hail on June 13,
2012.” Id. at 371–72. All but the last are outside of the policy
period.
Additionally, a letter from Haag Engineering dated August 11,
2016, clarifies that Haag Report No. 2 “inadvertently referred
to June 13, 2012, as the ‘most likely’ date that damage
occurred instead of the ‘most recent,’ as was concluded in
[the] April 8, 2015, report.” Doc. 33, Defs.' App. 402, Ex.
J, Haag Report No. 4. The letter goes on to state that “it
was never our intention to suggest that June 13, 2012, was
the known date or the only date that dents/damage occurred
at this property” and that “[m]eteorological study has been
performed that identifies additional dates in [sic] which
conditions were conducive to hail at the site prior to June
2012.” Id. at 403. Plaintiff also provided an affidavit from
Timothy Marshall, Principal Engineer and Meteorologist at
Haag Engineering, dated May 20, 2016, reiterating that “hail
greater than one inch in diameter likely fell at the Property on
four dates: a) March 10, 2010, b) May 24, 2011, c) April 3,
2012, and d) June 13, 2012.” Doc. 48, Pl.'s App. 245, Ex. L,
Aff. of Timothy Marshall.
Defendants submitted several supplemental documents
from Frontier Adjusters and Peninsula Insurance Bureau
which Defendants argue demonstrate that “the damage to
Defendants' property was caused by a hail storm on June
13, 2012” and that “Plaintiffs [sic] disregarded their own
adjuster and expert when they wrongfully denied Defendants'
claim.” Doc. 78-1, Defs.' Mot. for Leave to File Suppl.
Record 2. According to Defendants, these documents show
that Plaintiff “conducted a result-oriented investigation, first
deciding they would not pay the claim and then seeking
evidence to justify [its] position.” Id. at 4. Thus, Defendants
appear to infer from these letters and computer log notes
between Frontier Adjusters and Peninsula Insurance Bureau
regarding the progress of the claim that, because these third-
parties took steps to investigate and estimate the claimed
damage, they must have attributed the damage to the June
2012 storm, which Plaintiff then ignored.
*11  First, the Court notes that whether an insurer ignores a
third-party adjuster's recommendation regarding coverage is
irrelevant to the inquiry of whether the damage is ultimately
covered by the policy. For instance, an insurer may hire
twenty adjusters that all tell it that the damage is covered.
But if they all happen to be wrong, the damage is still not
covered. Thus, the insurer could not be held liable for breach
of the insurance contract for denying the claim. Such evidence
would seem more relevant to a common law bad faith or
statutory violation claim.
Second, far from establishing that the damage was due solely
to the June 2012 storm, Defendants' supplemental documents
actually support Plaintiff's position that it questioned the date
of loss prior to denying the claim based on the lapse of time
between the reported date of loss and the date the claim was
filed. See, e.g., Doc. 79, Defs.' Suppl. Records, Ex. B at 15
(computer log note dated June 11, 2015, from employee of
Frontier Adjusters documenting Underwriters's request for
additional investigation of “any hail storms” occurring “for
two years prior to” the date of claim and inquiry into “[h]ow
much damage would they have caused”). Thus, the Court
finds that these documents bring Defendants no closer to
establishing June 13, 2012, as the sole cause of damage, or to
providing a reasonable basis upon which a fact finder could
segregate the damage between the June 2012 storm and other
storms noted in the various weather reports in the record and
in Underwriters's possession at the time the claim was denied.

In sum, Underwriters has provided competent summary
judgment evidence that a non-covered peril—namely
multiple hail events outside the coverage period—could have
caused the damage. Therefore, “[Defendants] had the burden
of establishing evidence to allow the jury to segregate covered
losses from non-covered losses.” Atwill v. State Farm Lloyds,
No. 304CV1343-K, 2006 WL 1118155, at *2 (N.D. Tex.
Apr. 27, 2006) . But Defendants have provided no evidence
of the condition of the roofs either immediately before
or immediately after the June 2012 storm. “Federal courts
applying Texas law have held that summary judgment is
appropriate in cases where [parties] fail to raise a genuine
issue regarding the amount of damage attributable to covered
losses.” Clements v. State Farm Lloyds, No. H-05-0923, 2006
WL 5157426, at *13 (S.D. Tex. July 25, 2006) (citing Fiess v.
State Farm Lloyds, 392 F.3d 802, 807, 808 (5th Cir. 2004) );
Garza v. Allstate Tex. Lloyds, No. Civ.A.M-04-270, 2005 WL
2388254, at *4 (S.D. Tex. Sept. 28, 2005)  (“As [insurer]
has provided some evidence that excluded perils caused the
damage in question, and as [insured] has failed to set forth
any evidence that would allow the trier of fact to segregate
covered losses from uncovered losses, the Court GRANTS
[insurer's] Motion for Summary Judgment as to [insured's] ...
claim.”).
Because Defendants have failed to provide any evidence that
would allow the trier of fact to segregate covered losses from
non-covered losses, the Court concludes they have failed to
raise a genuine issue of material fact on this point. As a result,
Plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment on Defendants'
breach of contract counterclaim for this reason alone.
ii. Prompt notice
Although the Court's conclusion above is dispositive of
Defendants' breach of contract counterclaim, the Court
nevertheless considers Underwriters's “prompt notice”
argument for summary judgment as well. The Policy provides
that in the event of loss or damage, Defendants must “[g]ive
[Underwriters] prompt notice of the loss or damage.” Doc.
48, Pl.'s App. 141, Ex. D, Building and Personal Property
Coverage Form. Underwriters contends that Defendants
failed to comply with this provision by not reporting the
damage for over 30 months, which Underwriters argues
prejudiced it in two ways: (1) by depriving it of the
opportunity to fairly investigate the cause, nature, and extent
of the loss closer in time to when it allegedly occurred; and
(2) by increasing the cost to repair the damage. Doc. 47, Pl.'s
Br. 1–2. Accordingly, Underwriters contends it was relieved
of any obligation to perform under the Policy. Id. at 2. In
other words, Underwriters argues it was not required to pay
the claim because Defendants breached the “prompt notice”
provision of the Policy.
*12  Defendants, on the other hand, argue that “[t]he nature
of the loss was such that it was not immediately discoverable”
and that Defendants “reported the loss reasonably promptly
after they learned about the damage” in November 2014. Doc.
34, Defs.' Resp. 2. Moreover, according to Defendants, “any
delay on the part of Defendants in reporting the loss resulted
in no prejudice to Certain Underwriters, or at the very least
there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Certain
Underwriters was prejudiced.” Id.
As the parties appear to acknowledge, Texas has adopted
a notice-prejudice rule when analyzing notice provisions in
occurrence-based insurance policies like this one. See P AJ,
Inc. v. Hanover Ins. Co. , 243 S.W.3d 630, 634–35 (Tex.
2008); see also Ridglea Estate Condo. Ass'n v. Lexington
Ins. Co., 415 F.3d 474, 479–80 (5th Cir. 2005). Accordingly,
demonstrating the insured's late notice of a claim alone is
not enough to support an insurer's defense that the insured
breached the policy's notice requirement; rather, the insurer
must also establish that it was prejudiced by such delay. See
Ridglea, 415 F.3d at 479–80. As explained below, the Court
finds that Underwriters has met both prongs.
a. Unreasonable delay
The parties do not dispute the date of the alleged loss—June
13, 2012—or the date Defendants first provided notice of the
damage to Underwriters—December 29, 2014, the date of the
claim. They simply disagree on whether this delay of over two
and a half years violates the “prompt notice” requirement in
the Policy.
The Policy does not define “prompt notice,” but “Texas courts
have held that where ‘the policy does not define the term
“prompt,” [courts] construe the term as meaning that notice
must be given within a reasonable time after the occurrence.’
” Ridglea Estate Condo. Ass'n v. Lexington Ins. Co. , 415
F.3d 474, 479 (5th Cir. 2005)  (quoting Stonewall Ins. Co. v.
Modern Expl., Inc., 757 S.W.2d 432, 435 (Tex. App.—Dallas
1988, no writ)). And in cases with similar policy language to
the language here, the Supreme Court of Texas has held that

## Page 10

Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London v. Lowen Valley..., Not Reported in Fed....
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 10
property damage “occurs” when actual physical damage to the
property occurs. See Don's Bldg. Supply, Inc. v. OneBeacon
Ins. Co., 267 S.W.3d 20, 23–30 (Tex. 2008). Thus, in this case,
the damage occurred on June 13, 2012, the date of the storm
that Defendants allege caused the actual physical damage to
the property.
“While generally a question of fact, reasonableness becomes
a question of law if the facts are undisputed.” Alaniz v.
Sirius Int'l Ins. Corp., 626 Fed.Appx. 73, 76 (5th Cir. 2015).
Other courts have held that similar periods of time were not
prompt—i.e., not reasonable—as a matter of law in cases
involving hail damage. See, e.g. , id. at 76–78  (affirming
district court finding that notice was not prompt as a matter
of law where hail storm occurred in March 2012 but insured
did not provide notice until February 2014); Herrera v. State
Farm Lloyds , No. 5:15-cv-148, 2016 WL 1076911, at *3
(S.D. Tex. Mar. 18, 2016)  (holding that almost two years
between storm and notice was “unreasonable as a matter of
law”); Montemayor v. State Farm Lloyds , No. 1:15-cv-173,
2016 WL 4921553, at *2–3 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 7, 2016) (finding
two-year delay unreasonable as a matter of law); Gayton v.
Great Lakes Reinsurance (UK) PLC, No. 7:14-CV-229, 2014
WL 12538129, at *3–4 (S.D. Tex. Aug. 11, 2014) (“Because
the ... delay of almost two years is totally unexplained and
without excuse, the Court finds the delay unreasonable as a
matter of law.”); Galvan v. Great Lakes Reinsurance PLC ,
No. 7:14-CV-465, 2015 WL 12552009, at *2–3 (S.D. Tex.
Apr. 15, 2015) (“While there is no bright line rule, the Court
finds that waiting eighteen months to report a loss, especially
when no excuse is proffered for the delay, is not ‘prompt’ as
a matter of law.”). And in a case with strikingly similar facts
to those of this case, this Court has previously held that 19
months was not prompt as a matter of law. Hamilton, 2014
WL 3055801, at *8.
*13  Defendants attempt to distinguish these cases from
the present facts by arguing that the 30-month delay should
be excused because Defendants “did not initially notice
the damage” and because, according to Defendants, “[a]
reasonable policyholder cannot report a loss that they could
not have reasonably discovered yet.” Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp.
16, 17. Defendants offer the following facts in support of their
argument: (1) “the hail damage did not cause interior leaks to
the hotel which would have put Defendants on notice of the
damage”; (2) “Defendants do not conduct routine inspection
of the roofs because they can only be accessed by a crane
or lift”; (3) “Defendants did not have a protocol to evaluate
the hotel after hail storms”; and (4) “Defendants were not
aware that the hail storm had been severe enough to cause
any damage to the roof.” Id. at 16. Indeed, Mr. Desai was
apparently totally oblivious to the fact that a hail storm—
which totaled the hotel's roofs—had even occurred. See Doc.
33, Defs.' App. 6, Ex. B, Aff. of Ajay Desai ¶ 4 (“I was
not aware of the damage to the property caused by the June
13, 2012 hailstorm until November 2014. At the time of the
storm in 2012, no guests reported damage to their vehicles or
other property caused by hail. Likewise, none of my staff or
employees reported any damage or water leaks to the hotel
caused by hail. I am also not aware of any other businesses
in the area that sustained damages from the storm.”); see
also id. at 28, Ex. C, Exam. Under Oath of Ajay Desai (“Q:
Do you have any personal recollection of the hailstorm that
occurred on—supposedly occurred—here in the area on June
13, 2012? A: No. Q: Don't remember it? A: Don't remember
it.”). In essence, Defendants argue their good faith and a sort
of discovery rule should toll their “reasonable” time period
for reporting the damage.
Overlooking Defendants' apparent lack of routine
preventative maintenance protocols as to their roofs, as well
as evidence that the damage was visible to the naked eye from
the ground,8 the Court notes that Texas law requires prompt
notice “within a reasonable time after the occurrence,” not
within a reasonable time of discovery of the damage. Ridglea,
415 F.3d at 479 (emphasis added). “The date that the physical
damage is or could have been discovered is irrelevant....”
Don's Bldg. Supply , 267 S.W.3d at 24 ; Hamilton, 2014 WL
3055801, at *8  (finding plaintiff's insistence that he gave
notice “as soon as he reasonably realized that a covered claim
may exist” insufficient). As established above, the damage
“occurred” in this case, according to Defendants, on June 13,
2012. Thus, the Court has no problem finding that Defendants'
notice—given over 30 months after the damage allegedly
occurred—was not prompt as a matter of law. See Hamilton,
2014 WL 3055801, at *8 . Having found that Defendants'
notice of the claim was not prompt as a matter of law, the
Court now considers whether Underwriters was prejudiced by
the late notice.
b. Prejudice
*14  As noted above, Underwriters must also show that it
was prejudiced by Defendants' late notice. See Ridglea, 415
F.3d at 479–80. Underwriters relies primarily on the affidavit
of Derek Phipps to demonstrate how it was prejudiced by
Defendants' late notice of hail damage. First, Underwriters

points to the ways Phipps's inspection was impacted, such
as his inability to document the condition of the roofs
until more than two years after the alleged date of loss or
to determine how the roofs had been impacted by other
weather events or non-covered perils such as wear and tear
in the intervening time period. Doc. 47, Pl.'s Br. 15 (citing
Doc. 48, Pl.'s App. 212–15, Ex. H, Aff. of Derek Phipps).
Second, Underwriters argues that Defendants' late notice
“also prejudiced Underwriters[ ] because the cost to repair
the damage to the Property increased significantly during
the thirty-month delay.” Id. at 16. As evidence, Underwriters
points to the calculations of Derek Phipps, described in
Phipps's affidavit, using Xactimate to show that the estimate
would have been $47,802.67 less if the claim was reported
immediately following the loss so that Phipps could have used
June 2012 pricing data rather than January 2015 pricing data.
Id. at 17 (citing Doc. 48, Pl.'s App. 212–15, Ex. H, Aff. of
Derek Phipps). Accordingly, Underwriters contends it was
“relieved of any obligation to perform under the contract and
[is] entitled to summary judgment on Defendants' breach of
contract [counter]claim.” Doc. 46, Pl.'s Mot. 2.
Defendants respond that “any delay on the part of Defendants
in reporting the loss resulted in no prejudice to Certain
Underwriters, or at the very least there is a genuine
issue of material fact as to whether Certain Underwriters
was prejudiced.”  Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp. 2. According to
Defendants, while late notice may create an environment
where prejudice can occur, Underwriters has failed to bridge
the gap to demonstrate that it occurred in this case. Id. at
19 (citing Trumble, 304 Fed.Appx. at 244 ). As discussed
above, Defendants attempt to refute statements in Phipps's
affidavit that he had difficulty investigating the damage with
the fact that he was ultimately able to complete an estimate
of the cost to replace the damaged roofs. See id. at 19–20. 9
Thus, Defendants reason that because Phipps was able to
provide an estimate of the cost to replace the damage he
observed in January 2015 to Frontier Adjusters, who then
passed the estimate along to Peninsula Insurance Bureau
and ultimately to Underwriters, Phipps's investigation—and
therefore Underwriters's investigation—must not have been
prejudiced. Therefore, Defendants insist summary judgment
is inappropriate.
“When an insurer must prove it was prejudiced by the
insured's failure to comply with the notice provisions, ‘the
recognized purposes of the notice requirements form the
boundaries of the insurer's argument that it was prejudiced;
a showing of prejudice generally requires a showing that
one of the recognized purposes has been impaired.’ ”
Blanton v. Vesta Lloyds Ins. Co. , 185 S.W.3d 607, 612
(Tex. App.—Dallas 2006, no pet.)  (quoting 13 Couch on
Insurance § 186:14 (3d ed. 2005)). “The purpose of the notice
requirement is to enable an insurer to promptly investigate
the circumstances of an accident while the matter is still
fresh in the minds of the witnesses, to prevent fraud, and
to enable [the insurer] to form an intelligent estimate of its
rights and liabilities under the policy so that it may adequately
prepare to defend any claim that may arise.” Stonewall, 757
S.W.2d at 435 (citing Weaver v. Hartford Accident & Indem.
Co., 570 S.W.2d 367, 369 (Tex. 1978) ; Emp'rs Cas. Co. v.
Glen Falls Ins. Co., 484 S.W.2d 570, 575 (Tex. 1972)). Thus,
“prejudice from failure to notify timely arises from inability
to investigate the circumstances of an occurrence and prepare
adequately to adjust or defend any claims....” Blanton, 185
S.W.3d at 615.
But “an insurer must offer ‘more than the mere fact that it
cannot employ its normal procedures in investigating and
evaluating the claim.’ ” Trumble Steel Erectors, Inc. v. Moss,
304 Fed.Appx. 236, 244 (5th Cir. 2008) (per curiam) (quoting
Transportes Ferreos de Venezuela II CA v. NKK Corp. , 239
F.3d 555, 561 (3d Cir. 2001)). The insurer must show that it
was prejudiced “in some tangible way.” Berkley Reg'l Ins. Co.
v. Phila. Indem. Ins. Co., 690 F.3d 342, 349 (5th Cir. 2012) .
Though the existence of prejudice is generally a fact question,
the Court may decide the issue on summary judgment “if
the undisputed facts establish prejudice sufficient to relieve
an insurer of its obligations.” St. Paul Guardian Ins. Co. v.
Centrum G.S. Ltd., 383 F. Supp. 2d 891, 902 (N.D. Tex. 2003).
*15  Other courts have held that an affidavit from an insurer
listing the ways that an insured's failure to give prompt notice
prejudiced the insurer “was sufficient to establish prejudice as
a matter of law.” See, e.g., Camacho v. Allstate Texas Lloyds,
No. 7:14-CV-581, 2015 WL 12532486, at *3 (S.D. Tex. May
20, 2015) (“This Court has previously held that an affidavit
from a claims manager for the defendant insurer listing
the ways that the plaintiff's failure to give prompt notice
prejudiced the insurer was sufficient to establish prejudice
as a matter of law under the facts of that case.” ). The Court
has already noted that the simple fact that an estimate of
damages was “completed” says nothing of that investigation's
quality. See Hamilton, 2014 WL 3055801, at *10 . Instead,
Phipps explains in both his affidavit and his deposition how
his investigation was impacted. See Doc. 48, Pl.'s App. 212–
15, Ex. H, Aff. of Derek Phipps; see also  Doc. 33, Defs.'
App. 131–33, Ex. D, Dep. of Derek Phipps. “[P]rejudice from

failure to notify timely arises from the inability to investigate
the circumstances of an occurrence to prepare adequately to
adjust or defend any claim....” Blanton, 185 S.W.3d at 615
(emphasis added). Thus, Defendants' attempt to twist the fact
that Phipps was able to provide a damage estimate into an
opinion that the damage he saw was due to the storm on
the date of loss provided to him and that, therefore, he must
have been able to complete a full and fair investigation is
unpersuasive.
Yet even if the Court were to disregard Phipps's sworn
testimony as to how his inspection was impacted by the delay,
the Court would still find as a matter of law that the late notice
resulted in tangible prejudice to Underwriters because the
evidence shows that the cost to repair the damage increased
by $47,802.67, or roughly ten percent, between June 2012
and January 2015. Underwriters provided evidence, utilizing
the Xactimate estimating program, that if Defendants had
reported the loss immediately after the June 2012 storm, the
cost to repair the damage would have been $424,225.41 at
that time. Doc. 47, Pl.'s Br. 17 (citing Doc. 48, Pl.'s App.
212–15, Ex. H, Aff. of Derek Phipps; id. at 250–257, Ex. N,
Phipps Damage Estimate (June 2012 pricing)). But because
Defendants reported the loss on December 29, 2014, the cost
to complete the same repairs using January 2015 pricing was
$472,028.08. Id. (citing Doc. 48, Pl.'s App. 212–15, Ex. H,
Aff. of Derek Phipps; id. at 231–38, Ex. J, Phipps Damage
Estimate (January 2015 pricing)).
As noted above, Defendants do not appear to take issue with
Plaintiff's use of Xactimate in general or even the estimates it
generated in this case specifically. Rather, Defendants argue
that “[t]he fact that Phipps could have used the June 2012
Xactimate pricing at any point during the investigation, is
actually proof that Certain Underwriters could have avoided
any prejudice caused by the time delay.” Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp.
21. Confusingly, Defendants appear to argue that because
Underwriters has no evidence of how the condition of the
roofs changed between the time of the June 2012 storm and
the time Defendants filed their claim—because Defendants
did not report the damage for over two and a half years—
that Underwriters cannot show that the cost to repair the
damage increased during that time. On the contrary, the Court
can imagine no better evidence of tangible prejudice than
pricing data demonstrating that the cost to repair the damage
increased during the period of delay, regardless of whether the
condition of the roofs changed during that period.
Furthermore, Plaintiff would have had no reason to use the
June 2012 pricing “at any point during the investigation”
because there was not even an insurance claim until December
29, 2014. Therefore, construing the facts in the light most
favorable to Defendants, the Court finds as a matter of law
that Underwriters was prejudiced by Defendants' failure to
provide prompt notice. Thus, Plaintiff is entitled to summary
judgment on Defendants' breach of contract counterclaim on
this ground as well.
2. Defendants' Texas Insurance Code Counterclaims
The Court turns next to Defendants' counterclaims for
violations of the Texas Insurance Code and Underwriters's
motion for summary judgment thereupon. Defendants
contend that Underwriters “violated several provisions of
Texas Insurance Code § 541.060 by, among other things (1)
conducting an unreasonable, untimely, and results-oriented
investigation; (2) refusing to affirm or deny coverage within
a reasonable time; and (3) attempting to coerce Defendants
into accepting a grossly unfair and inadequate offer and
signing a release.” Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp. 29–30. Regarding
their § 542 counterclaims, Defendants argue Underwriters
“failed to timely acknowledge the claim, failed to conduct
a reasonable and timely investigation, and refused to affirm
or deny coverage within a reasonable time in violation of
Chapter 542 of the Texas Insurance Code, known as the Texas
‘Prompt Payment of Claims Act’ (PPCA).” Id. at 31.
*16  Underwriters moved for summary judgment on
each of these counterclaims, arguing that Defendants'
Insurance Code claims necessarily fail because the breach of
contract counterclaim fails and Defendants cannot show any
independent injury outside of the claim for benefits under the
Policy. Doc. 47, Pl.'s Br. 18–19. According to Underwriters,
because the loss was not covered under the Policy, Defendants
cannot recover for a statutory violation without injury
independent of the policy benefits, which Defendants
cannot, or at least have not, shown. For the reasons that
follow, the Court agrees with Underwriters. Therefore,
summary judgment in favor of Underwriters is warranted on
Defendants' Texas Insurance Code counterclaims.
i. Section 541
Defendants contend that Underwriters breached § 541 of
the Texas Insurance Code by “disregard[ing] all evidence in
[its] possession which clearly established that Defendants'

## Page 13

Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London v. Lowen Valley..., Not Reported in Fed....
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 13
loss was a covered loss,” by “delay[ing] communicating a
coverage decision to the insured for almost 15 months,” and
by “attempting to coerce [Defendants] to settle the claim
for an amount lower than the covered damages and to sign
a complete release of liability by threatening to pursue a
declaratory judgment action.” Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp. 30, 31.
Section 541 prohibits an insurer from “failing to attempt
in good faith to effectuate a prompt, fair, and equitable
settlement of ... a claim with respect to which the insurer's
liability has become reasonably clear” or “refusing to pay
a claim without conducting a reasonable investigation with
respect to the claim.” Tex. Ins. Code Ann. § 541.060(a)(2)
(A), (7). Other prohibited conduct includes failing to affirm
or deny coverage or submit a reservation of rights to a
policyholder within a reasonable time, or “undertaking to
enforce a full and final release of a claim from a policyholder
when only a partial payment has been made, unless the
payment is a compromise settlement of a doubtful or disputed
claim.” Id. § 541.060(4), (6).
Liability under § 541 of the Texas Insurance Code is analyzed
under the same standard as common-law bad faith claims.
See Hamilton Props. v. Am. Ins. Co., 643 Fed.Appx. 437, 442
(5th Cir. 2016) (citing Tex. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sara Care Child
Care Ctr., Inc., 324 S.W.3d 305, 317 (Tex. App.—El Paso
2010, pet. denied)). An insurer breaches its common law duty
of good faith and fair dealing “if the insurer knew or should
have known that it was reasonably clear that the claim was
covered,” but nevertheless denied or unreasonably delayed
paying it. Universe Life Ins. Co. v. Giles , 950 S.W.2d 48,
55–56 (Tex. 1997). “Evidence establishing only a bona fide
coverage dispute does not demonstrate bad faith.” State Farm
Fire & Cas. Co. v. Simmons, 963 S.W.2d 42, 44 (Tex. 1998).
Generally, “there can be no claim for bad faith when an insurer
has promptly denied a claim that is in fact not covered.”
Republic Ins. Co. v. Stoker, 903 S.W.2d 338, 341 (Tex. 1995).
An exception exists, however, when an insurer's conduct is
“so extreme, that it would cause injury independent of the
policy claim.” Id. (citing Aranda v. Ins. Co. of N. Am. , 748
S.W.2d 210, 214 (Tex. 1988), overruled on other grounds by
Tex. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Ruttiger, 381 S.W.3d 430 (Tex. 2012)).
Underwriters argues that Defendants have neither alleged nor
proven that they suffered any injury independent of the denial
of policy benefits. Doc. 47, Pl.'s Br. 19. Therefore, according
to Underwriters, because Defendants cannot prevail on their
breach of contract counterclaim, they likewise cannot succeed
on their extra-contractual claims under the Texas Insurance
Code. Id. at 18–20. Defendants, for their part, argue that the
confusing state of Texas law regarding whether “independent
injury” is required when the only damages sought are unpaid
coverage benefits necessitates that this Court hold off on
deciding the motion for summary judgment until the Texas
Supreme Court issues its opinion in USAA Tex. Lloyds Co. v.
Menchaca, which addressed the exact question at issue here.
Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp. 23.
*17  Fortunately, the Texas Supreme Court delivered its
opinion in Menchaca on April 7, 2017. See USAA Tex. Lloyds
Co. v. Menchaca, No. 14-0721, 2017 WL 1311752 (Tex. Apr.
7, 2017) . In Menchaca, the Supreme Court articulated the
issue as follows:
The primary question in this case is whether an insured
can recover policy benefits as actual damages caused by an
insurer's statutory violation absent a finding that the insured
had a contractual right to the benefits under the insurance
policy.
Id. at *4. After reaffirming the general rule that “an insured
cannot recover policy benefits as damages for an insurer's
statutory violation if the policy does not provide the insured a
right to receive those benefits,” the court went on to clarify the
application of the “independent injury” rule. Id. According
to Menchaca, “if an insurer's statutory violation causes an
injury independent of the loss of policy benefits, the insured
may recover damages for that injury even if the policy does
not grant the insured a right to benefits.” Id. Or stated in
the negative, “an insured cannot recover any damages based
on an insurer's statutory violation if the insured had no right
to receive benefits under the policy and sustained no injury
independent of a right to benefits.” Id.
Here, the Court has already determined that Defendants
have failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact on
their counterclaim for breach of contract. In other words,
Defendants have not demonstrated that the claimed damage
was “covered” under the Policy. Or in the language of
Menchaca, they have not demonstrated a “right to receive
benefits under the policy.” Id. Therefore, Defendants' only
route to damages for a statutory violation would be to
demonstrate that they suffered an “injury independent of a
right to benefits.” Id.
Defendants have provided no evidence, and indeed do not
even attempt to argue, that Underwriters's conduct was “so
extreme” as to cause “injury independent of a right to
benefits” under the Policy. Stoker, 903 S.W.2d at 341. Rather,

## Page 14

Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London v. Lowen Valley..., Not Reported in Fed....
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 14
Defendants argue that “the so-called ‘independent injury’
rule ... simply does not apply to cases like this one ... where
the actual damages sought are coverage benefits due under the
policy.” Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp. 24. Thus, Defendants assume
independent injury is not required in this case because they
assume the claimed damages are covered.
Yet the Court has concluded that the claimed damages are
not covered as a matter of law. So independent injury is
required. And Defendants have failed to provide any evidence
to raise a fact issue that the alleged statutory violations caused
any injury independent of the policy benefits sought. See
Mid–Continent Cas. Ins. Co. v. Eland Energy, Inc., 709 F.3d
515, 521 (5th Cir. 2013) (observing that “in seventeen years
since [ Stoker,] no Texas court has yet held that recovery
is available for an insurer's extreme act....”). Therefore,
without addressing whether the specific alleged conduct
would constitute a violation of § 541, the Court finds that
Underwriters is entitled to summary judgment on Defendants'
§ 541 counterclaims because Defendants cannot succeed on
their breach of contract claim as a matter of law, and they
have provided no evidence of injury independent of the policy
benefits.
ii. Section 542
*18  The Court next considers Defendants' counterclaim
that Underwriters violated § 542 of the Insurance Code.
Defendants contend that, “[i]n addition to breaching the
contract and failing to pay a covered claim in bad faith
violation of Chapter 541, Certain Underwriters failed to
timely acknowledge the claim, failed to conduct a reasonable
and timely investigation, and refused to affirm or deny
coverage within a reasonable time in violation of Chapter
542 of the Texas Insurance Code, known as the Texas
‘Prompt Payment of Claims Act’ (PPCA).” Doc. 34, Defs.'
Resp. 31. Defendants argue that between the date of the
Reservation of Rights Letter in March 2015 and the request
for an Examination Under Oath of Desai in December
2015, Underwriters “inspected the property several times
but never provided [Defendants] with any of the several
reports and estimates Certain Underwriters obtained.” Id.
at 32. According to Defendants, “[a]ll evidence discovered
during their investigation indicated that [Defendants'] loss
was covered, but Certain Underwriters delayed making a
coverage decision” and eventually “disregarded all evidence
in their possession” and denied the claim. Id.
“The Prompt Payment of Claims Act prohibits insurers from
delaying the payment of first-party claims.” Trammel Crow
Residential Co. v. Va. Sur. Co., 643 F. Supp. 2d 844, 857 (N.D.
Tex. 2008) (citing Tex. Ins. Code Ann. §§ 542.051 –.061).
It “establishes a series of claim-handling and claim-payment
deadlines for insurers” and “provides additional damages
when an insurer wrongfully refuses or delays payment of a
claim.” Weiser-Brown Operating Co. v. St. Paul Surplus Lines
Ins. Co. , 801 F.3d 512, 518 (5th Cir. 2015)  (citing Lamar
Homes, Inc. v. Mid-Continent Cas. Co. , 242 S.W.3d 1, 16
(Tex. 2007)). “[T]o maintain a claim under Chapter 542 of the
Texas Insurance Code, a party must show: (1) ‘a “first-party”
claim under an insurance policy’; (2) ‘the insurer's liability for
that claim’; and (3) ‘the insurer's failure to follow one or more
sections of the statute with respect to handling that claim.’
” Johnson v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Ind. , No. 3:15-CV-1939-B,
2017 WL 879211, at *10 (N.D. Tex. Mar. 6, 2017)  (citing
Hulcher Servs., Inc. v. Great Am. Ins. Co., No. 4:14-CV-231,
2015 WL 3921903, at *11 (E.D. Tex. June 25, 2015); Weiser-
Brown, 801 F.3d at 518). In other words, liability for the claim
is a precondition to liability under Chapter 542. Id. (citing
Wellisch v. United Servs. Auto. Ass'n , 75 S.W.3d 53, 57 n.2
(Tex. App.—San Antonio 2002, pet. denied)).
Again without reaching the merits, the Court can quickly
dispose of Defendants' Chapter 542 counterclaim. Here, the
Court has already determined that Defendants cannot succeed
on their breach of contract counterclaim as a matter of law.
Therefore, they cannot show that the insurer is “liable for
the claim,” as is required to prove a violation of § 542.
Accordingly, in light of the Court's previous determination
that Underwriters is not liable for Defendants' claim under
the Policy, Underwriters is entitled to summary judgment on
Defendants' counterclaim for violation of § 542 of the Texas
Insurance Code.
3. Declaratory Judgment
This lawsuit originated as a declaratory judgment action
by Underwriters, asking for “judgment against Defendants
declaring that there is no coverage under policy number
NJL440003612 for the reported hail damage because
Defendants violated the policy's notice condition and
Underwriters suffered prejudice as a result.” Doc. 1, Original
Compl. & Req. for Declaratory J. ¶ 21; see also  Doc. 23,
1st Am. Original Compl. & Req. for Declaratory J. ¶ 22
(requesting same). In response, Defendants, in addition to
filing the counterclaims for breach of contract and violations
of the Texas Insurance Code addressed above, requested a
declaratory judgment of their own: “that the Policy provides

## Page 15

Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London v. Lowen Valley..., Not Reported in Fed....
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 15
coverage for the cost to repair the damaged property, less only
a deductible, among other things.” Doc. 11, Defs.' Answer &
Countercls. ¶ 45.
Underwriters did not mention its request for, or Defendants'
counterclaim for, declaratory judgment in its motion
for summary judgment. But “district courts are widely
acknowledged to possess the power to enter summary
judgments sua sponte , so long as the losing party was on
notice that [it] had to come forward with all of [its] evidence.”
Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 326 (1986).
*19  The Fifth Circuit “has reversed summary judgment were
a moving party's memorandum failed to raise a point ‘in a
manner that would be sufficient to put the [non-moving party]
on notice that failure to present evidence of [the elements of
each of its claims] could be grounds for summary judgment.’
” Tramago, L.P . v. Euler-Hermes Am. Credit Indem. Co., 602
Fed.Appx. 981, 984 (5th Cir. 2015) (quoting John Deere Co.
v. Am. Nat'l Bank, Stafford , 809 F.2d 1190, 1191 (5th Cir.
1987)). But that is not the case here.
The whole purpose of Underwriters's declaratory judgment
action was to secure a finding that the Policy did not provide
coverage for the claimed loss. Defendants, on the other hand,
requested the opposite declaration—a finding of coverage.
Because resolution of the parties' respective declaratory
judgment claims amounts simply to a resolution of the
coverage issue, the Court finds that Plaintiff's motion for
summary judgment on Defendants' counterclaim for breach
of contract was sufficient to put Defendants on notice that
they needed to bring all of their evidence in support of their
requested declaration of coverage. Thus, in holding above that
Defendants cannot succeed as a matter of law on their breach
of contract counterclaim, the Court has in effect declared “no
coverage.” Therefore, the Court finds that Defendants were
“on notice that [they] had to come forward with all of their
evidence.” Thomas v. EMC Mortg. Corp., 499 Fed.Appx. 337,
341 (5th Cir. 2012)  (quoting Celotex, 477 U.S. at 326 ). For
that reason, summary judgment in favor of Underwriters on
the claims for declaratory relief is also warranted at this time.
IV .
CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, summary judgment is
GRANTED in favor of Underwriters on Defendants'
counterclaims for breach of the insurance contract and
violations of the Texas Insurance Code, and these claims
are DISMISSED with prejudice . Accordingly, the Court
also GRANTS summary judgment sua sponte  in favor
Underwriters on its request for declaratory relief and
DENIES sua sponte  Defendants' request for declaratory
relief.10 An Order of Final Judgment will follow.
SO ORDERED.

1 This factual history is drawn from the parties' summary judgment briefing and evidence, as well as their pleadings. Any
disputed fact is noted as the contention of a particular party.
2 There does not appear to be any significance to the beginning date of the roofer's search, January 1, 2006. And the only
significance of December 21, 2014, appears to be that it was the day before the report was requested.
3 Though it does not appear to be a point of contention between the parties, there is some confusion as to the actual date
of Phipps's inspection. Plaintiff indicates the inspection took place on January 12, 2015. Doc. 47, Pl.'s Br. 4. Defendants
state it took place on January 16, 2015. Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp. 5. Phipps's actual report provides a “Date Inspected” of
January 14, 2015. Doc. 48, Pl.'s App. 232. For what it's worth, Phipps's affidavit indicates he inspected the property on
January 12, 2015. Doc. 48, Pl.'s App. 214, Ex. H, Aff. of Derek Phipps ¶ 6. Suffice it to say his investigation took place
in mid-January.
4 From the evidence it appears that Phipps's Damage Estimate includes only the cost to replace the roofs, not the cost
to repair the damage to the exterior siding. Apparently, Phipps was waiting to hear back from other contractors before
submitting an estimate for the siding, but it does not appear that he ever heard back from the contractors or submitted an

updated estimate. See Doc. 33, Defs.' App. 412, Ex. K, Phipps Computer Log Notes (entry from Jan. 16, 2015, stating
“The exterior EIFS has hail damage on each elevation requiring repairs and bids from two local stucco/eifs contractors....
IA is coordinating with contractor and owner/insured to obtain the exterior bids.”); id. at 150, Ex. E, Phipps Damage
Estimate (noting that certain work referenced in the estimate was to be “performed by the roofing contractor” and thus
would not be “included in the exterior EIFS repair bid amount”); id. at 71, Ex. D, Dep. of Derek Phipps (“A: So before I
made a recommendation, I just requested that a stucco/EIFS professional give their recommendation for it....”); id. at 82
(“Q: ... just so I'm clear on this, this estimate that you prepared is the hail damage that you saw at the Hilton Garden Inn
to the three roof systems? A: Correct.”); id. at 86 (“Q: Okay. And did you ever get a copy of the EIFS damage estimate
from the contractor? A: I did not. Q: Do you recall sending any subsequent reports to either Frontier or their carrier after
your initial report on January 19th of 2015? A: I do not.”).
5 Underwriters subsequently requested and was granted leave to file an Amended Complaint incorporating additional
allegations but no new causes of action (Doc. 20, Pl.'s Unopposed Mot. for Leave to File Am. Compl.; Doc. 21, Electronic
Order Granting Mot. for Leave), which Plaintiff then filed on July 11, 2016. Confusingly, Plaintiff actually filed its Amended
Complaint twice. See Docs. 22 and 23. These documents appear to be identical, so the Court considers the later-filed
(Doc. 23) to be the operative pleading.
In another strange turn of events, Defendants never filed an updated answer in response to Plaintiff's Amended Complaint.
Nor has Plaintiff, for that matter, ever filed an answer to Defendants' counterclaims. Thus, although both sides are
technically in default, neither has raised the issue, and the parties appear to be proceeding with the understanding that
Defendants' original Answer and Counterclaims (Doc. 11)—though filed in response to Plaintiff's Original Complaint (Doc.
1)—also serves as a responsive pleading to Plaintiff's later-filed Amended Complaint (Doc. 23). Therefore, so will the
Court. See Superior Edge, Inc. v. Monsanto Co., 44 F. Supp. 3d 890, 893 n.2 (D. Minn. 2014) (citing Cartier v. Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A., 547 Fed.Appx. 800, 804 (8th Cir. 2013) (“Under these circumstances, we conclude the district court acted
within its discretion to treat the motion to dismiss the original complaint as a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.”)).
6 Plaintiff initially filed a motion for summary judgment on July 27, 2016 (Doc. 24), then asked to withdraw it the following day
(Doc. 25), which the Court allowed (Doc. 26). Plaintiff later re-filed its motion for summary judgment in November 2016.
Doc. 29. The following month, however, recognizing the Court's local rule requiring that a motion, brief, and appendix be
filed as separate documents, Plaintiff requested leave to re-file its motion in accordance with that rule (Doc. 41), which
the Court granted (Doc. 45). Plaintiff then filed the present Amended Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 46), Brief in
Support (Doc. 47), and Appendix (Doc. 48) in December 2016, the only difference from the November 2016 filing being
that the motion, brief, and appendix are now separate documents. Thus, although the Court acknowledges November 2,
2016, as the date of filing, all references in this opinion are to the Amended Motion (Doc. 46) and its attendant documents.
7 Defendants later requested (Doc. 78), and were granted (Doc. 83), leave to file several supplemental documents in
opposition to Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.
8 Although Defendants contend they had “no reasonable way of knowing there was damage to the roof without someone
getting up onto the roof with a lift or crane” (Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp. 16), Mr. Desai testified under oath that he first noticed
in November 2014—coincidentally, while “evaluating the property for potential capital improvements” (id.)—that “[w]hen
you drive up to the hotel, the shingles look really bad.” Doc. 33, Defs.' App. 18, Ex. C, Exam. Under Oath of Ajay Desai.
Defendants have not argued or provided any evidence that the damage from the June 2012 storm first manifested in
November 2014. In fact, Defendants acknowledge that “the type of roof damage at issue is not the type which becomes
more severe over time....” Doc. 34, Defs.' Resp. 21. Desai also testified that he visited the property approximately once
a week. Doc. 33, Defs.' App. 18, Ex. C., Exam. Under Oath of Ajay Desai. Presumably, then, the “bad” roofs would have
been visible to Mr. Desai every week when he drove up to the hotel between the date of the storm and November 2014.
Furthermore, as mentioned above, the damage is not only to the roofs but also to the hotel's siding. See, e.g., Doc. 33,
Defs.' App. 412, Ex. K, Phipps Computer Log Notes (noting that the “exterior EIFS has hail damage on each elevation
requiring repairs and bids from two local stucco/eifs contractors”). And though Derek Phipps noted that distinguishing
hail damage from other types of damage might require some level of expertise, he also testified that there was clearly
damage to the hotel's siding which was visible from the ground. Compare  Doc. 33, Defs.' App. 100, Ex. D, Dep. of Derek
Phipps (“Q: Do you agree that, in order to determine damage to EIFS from hail, as opposed to some other type of loss

28 (“Q: .... With your naked eye, if you're walking at ground level, at this hotel, at this property ... can you see damage
to the EIFS siding? A: You can. Q: And do you need a ladder to see that? A: No. Q: Do you need a lift to see that? A:
No. I found the damage as we were walking around it....”).
9 Defendants also point to the letters and computer log notes between Frontier Adjusters and Peninsula Insurance Bureau
mentioned above to argue that because the claim appeared to be moving along through the claims process, Underwriters
was “able to conduct a full, fair and complete investigation of Defendants' loss.” Doc. 78-1, Defs.' Mot. for Leave to File
Suppl. Record 2.
10 Because this order is dispositive of the case, Underwriters's Objections to Defendants' Expert Witness Disclosure (Doc.
58) is OVERRULED as moot  at this time. Additionally, the parties' Joint Motion for Status Conference (Doc. 90) is also
DENIED as moot.
