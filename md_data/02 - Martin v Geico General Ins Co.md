ORDER ON DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO STRIKE
PLAINTIFF'S EXPERT WITNESSES
JANE J. BOYLE, United States Magistrate Judge.
*1  BEFORE THE COURT is Defendants' Motion to Strike
Plaintiff's Expert Witnesses (the “Motion”). After reviewing
the Motion, Plaintiff's Response, and Defendants' Reply
Brief, and fully considering the arguments of counsel, the
Court is of the opinion that the Motion should be GRANTED
in part and DENIED in part. The Court
FINDS that the proffered expert testimony of Dr. Heuser
and Dr. Chandos extends beyond the scope of their personal
knowledge as treating physicians. Therefore, the Court
GRANTS the Motion and ORDERS Plaintiff to fully comply
with Rule 26(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on
or before June 10, 2002.
The Court further DENIES the Motion to exclude Dr. Heuser
and Dr. Chandos' expert testimony without PREJUDICE to
the Defendants from re-filing the same after Plaintiff has fully
complied with this Order.
