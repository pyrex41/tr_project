MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
JANE J. BOYLE, District Judge.
*1  Before the Court are Defendant's Motion to Strike
Plaintiff's Expert Designation (doc. 69) and Plaintiff's
Motion for Leave of Court and First Amended Expert
Witness Designations (doc. 79). For the reasons that follow
Defendant's Motion is GRANTED and Plaintiff's Motion is
DENIED.
I.
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Marqueth Wilson is suing Defendant Home Depot
U.S.A., Inc. (“Home Depot”) for personal injuries allegedly
sustained as a result of an alleged incident that occurred at a
Home Depot store in Dallas, Texas on May 14, 2012. Doc.
6, First Am. Pet. Plaintiff alleges that he was asked by a
Home Depot employee to assist him with cutting plywood.
Id. at 2. In the course of cutting the wood, Plaintiff claims
the employee dropped the end he was holding, which caused
Plaintiff to “jerk and suddenly shift.” Id. at 3. Plaintiff alleges
this caused bodily injury and exacerbated and/or aggravated
a preexisting back injury. Id.
Plaintiff brought suit against Home Depot on December 3,
2012 in the 193rd Judicial District Court of Dallas County,
Texas. Doc 1, Not. Rem. Thereafter Home Depot removed
the case to this Court on December 31, 2012. Id. On February
13, 2013, the Court entered a Scheduling Order, which set
a deadline of August 16, 2013 for Plaintiff to designate
expert witnesses. Doc. 22. On August 14, 2013, Plaintiff
served his Expert Designation. On November 11, 2013, Home
Depot filed its present Motion to Strike Plaintiff's Expert
Designation.1 In response, Plaintiff filed his Motion for Leave
of Court and First Amended Expert Witness Designations.
The Court considers them both below.
II.
ANALYSIS
A. Motion to Strike Plaintiff's Expert Designation
Home Depot moves the Court to strike Plaintiff's Expert
Designations and prohibit all of the four doctors identified
therein from testifying at trial. Home Depot claims that
Plaintiff's designation was deficient because it failed to
include any expert reports and similarly failed to disclose the
subject areas and/or a summary of the facts to which each
witness is expected to testify. Def.'s Mot. 2. Home Depot
argues Plaintiff has therefore failed to comply with Rule 26(a)
(2)(C) and should be prohibited from using any information
from those witnesses at trial. Id.; Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(C),
37(c)(1). Plaintiff responds that he complied with the Federal
Rules as best he could, though “pages 141 and 142 and various
other pages” were missing from the prison law library. Pl.'s
Mot. 2. Plaintiff further claims that in August 2013 he “did
not have access to telephones to contact ‘only’ his family.”
Id. In addition he maintains he separately provided, via his
Initial Disclosures, “the content and subject matter on which
each expert's testimony is sought.” Id. at 3. Finally, he states
has written letters to his proposed experts requesting they
submit curriculum vitae and records, but he has received no
responses. Id .  He insists any expert reports will therefore
have to be subpoenaed by the Court. Id.
*2  Home Depot counters that Plaintiff had ample time
to acquire knowledge and collect information necessary to
properly designate experts. Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Mot. What's
more, Plaintiff's proposed amended filing still fails to provide
a summary of the facts or any of the opinions of the proposed
experts. Id. at 3. Furthermore, the medical records that

Plaintiff previously supplied in his Initial Disclosures do not
include the experts' opinions and therefore have not provided
Home Depot with notice of the doctors' possible testimony.
Id. at 3–4.
Under federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2)(B) , a party
who retains an expert to provide expert testimony in a case
must submit a report that includes: (1) a complete statement
of all opinions of the witness and the reasons for them; (2) the
facts or data the expert considered in forming his opinion; (3)
any exhibits that will be used; (4) the witness's qualifications,
including publications; (5) a list of all other cases in which
he has testified in the previous four years; and (6) a statement
of his compensation in the present case. Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)
(B)(i)-(vi). If for some reason the witness is not required to
provide such a report, Rule 26(a)(2)(C) nevertheless requires
a party to disclose: (1) the subject matter on which the witness
is expected to present evidence, and (2) a summary of the facts
and opinions to which the witness is expected to testify. Id. at
(a)(2)(C). If a party fails to provide information as required
under Rule 26(a), he may not use that information or witness
to “supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial,
unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.”
Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(c)(1).
“A district court considers four factors when determining
if such a violation is harmless: (1) the explanation, if any,
for the non-disclosing party's failure to comply with the
discovery rule; (2) the prejudice to the opposing party; (3)
the possibility of curing such a prejudice by granting a
continuance; and (4) the importance of the evidence and
related witnesses' testimony.” Reyes v. City of Farmers
Branch, Texas, No. 3:07–CV–900–O, 2008 WL 4791498, at
*3 (N.D.Tex. Nov.4, 2008) (citing Barrett v. Atlantic Richfield
Co., 95 F.3d 375, 380 (5th Cir.1996)). “The Court has broad
discretion in deciding whether a violation of Rule 26(a)  is
substantially justified or harmless.” Id. (citing United States
v. $9,041,598.68, 163 F.3d 238, 252 (5th Cir.1998)).
There is no question that Plaintiff's initial Expert Designation
did not comply with Rule 26 . Indeed, Plaintiff provided
nothing more than the names and addresses of the four
doctors on which he hoped to rely. Def.'s Ex. A, Plaintiff's
Expert Designation. This falls well short of Rule 26(a)(2)
(B), which requires a party include reports that are “detailed
and complete” rather than “sketchy and vague.” Sierra Club,
Lone Star Chapter v. Cedar Point Oil Co., Inc., 73 F.3d 546,
571 (5th Cir.1996). It similarly does not meet Rule 26(a)(2)
(C)'s mandate of “a summary of the facts and opinions to
which the witness is expected to testify.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)
(2)(C)(ii). The Court must thus consider whether striking this
designation is warranted.
1. Explanation for Non–Disclosing Party's Failure to
Comply
*3  Regarding the first factor, the Court finds that Plaintiff's
explanation for his non-compliance is inadequate. Plaintiff
attributes his disobedience to the fact that the prison law
library's copy of the Rules of Civil Procedure lacked certain
pages. However, Plaintiff has not indicated that the missing
pages actually contained the Rule in question. Furthermore,
the Court's Scheduling Order afforded Plaintiff over six
months to file his expert designation and report. Doc. 22. That
was a considerable amount of time to recognize the missing
pages and attempt to research the requirements. Though
Plaintiff claims he had limited phone access in August 2013,
he has offered no reason why he could not have contacted
individuals or performed the necessary research during any of
the months preceding. To the extent Plaintiff faced difficulty
from his own experts because they did not respond to his
requests for their curriculum vitae or reports, he could have
notified the Court of his inability to comply with the Rule by
the set deadline or otherwise sought assistance. However, he
did no such thing.
For these several reasons, Plaintiff's explanation for his
non-compliance falls short of justifiying the failings of his
designation, and the Court finds this factor weighs in favor of
striking his filing.
2. Prejudice to the Opposing Party
The second factor likewise weighs in favor of the sanction.
As Home Depot correctly points out, Plaintiff's initial Expert
Designation fails to disclose the opinions that his purported
experts will provide at trial. Indeed, it is devoid of any detail
whatsoever. Even Plaintiff's proposed amended filing states
only the general areas to be covered in the doctors' testimony
without providing any of the experts' opinions or the facts
on which they relied. See Doc. 79–1. In other words, neither
filing offers any guidance with respect to these individuals'
future testimony.
Despite Plaintiff's suggestion, the medical records he
previously provided to Home Depot do not cure these
deficiencies. The records from Drs. Kilgore and Goldings
are dated more than two years before the alleged incident at
Home Depot. Def.'s Exs. B, C. Accordingly, they provide no

insight into what these individuals might say with respect to
the issues at hand. The record from Dr. Batlle-a letter from
him to Dr. Jodoin-is from July 2012. Pl.'s Ex. D. It discusses
Plaintiff's injuries from an automobile accident on June 24,
2012 as well as from a work related injury in April 2009.
Id. Though the letter mentions Plaintiff had several accidents
during 2012, including in May, it is silent with respect to
their details. Id. In other words, nowhere does it mention the
alleged event or injuries associated with this suit. Similarly,
the records from Dr. Jodoin do not connect the cause of
Plaintiff's ongoing back pain and discomfort with the facts of
this case. Def.'s Ex. E, F. Though one record from June 27,
2012 indicates that Plaintiff had been treated at Dr. Jodoin's
office “for injuries sustained in a work injury on 05/14/2012,”
there is no further discussion of the accident or the injury.
Def.'s Ex. F. Furthermore, the record states that Plaintiff's
current symptoms “are directly related to a motor vehicle
accident sustained on 06/24/2012.” Id.
*4  Plaintiff has since filed a Supplemental Exhibit H (doc.
97), which includes Dr. Jodoin's curriculum vitae as well as
his “expert report.” However, review of this report shows that
it fails to meet the standards articulated by Rule 26. The two-
page letter begins with the statement that “in my professional
opinion, the accident injury that Mr. Wilson sustained at the
Home Depot on 05/14/2012 resulted in an exacerbation of a
pre-existing low back condition.” Supp. Ex. H. It then notes
Plaintiff's extensive history of injury to his low back and
mentions Plaintiff was leading a “full and active life” prior to
the alleged incident at Home Depot. Id. The letter concludes
by repeating Dr. Jodoin's opinion that the alleged encounter at
Home Depot exacerbated Plaintiff's low back complaint. Id.
An expert report must not only include a statement of all
opinions the witness will express, but also the reasons for such
opinions, including the facts and data the witness considered.
Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(B)(i)-(ii). Similarly, the report must
note any exhibits that will be used, a statement of the
compensation the expert has received, and a list of other
cases in which, during the previous four years, the witness
has testified as an expert. Id. at (iii)-(vi). The expert report
Plaintiff filed simply provides none of this information.
In fact, it seems to be precisely the “sketchy and vague”
information that Rule 26  was intended to prevent. Sierra
Club, 73 F.3d at 571.
In sum, neither Plaintiff's initial Expert Designation nor the
other records he provided nor his most recent supplement
includes the necessary disclosures under Rule 26(a)(2)(B)
or (a)(2)(C) . There is no information regarding three of
the four witnesses' qualifications, previous cases during
which any expert has testified, or statements about any of
their compensation. Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(B)(iii)-(vi). More
critically, there is no “complete statement of all opinions the
witness[es] will express and the basis and reasons for them”
and no disclosure of the facts or data they considered in
forming their opinions.  Id.; see also  Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)
(B). There is not even a summary of the facts and opinions
to which the doctors' will testify. Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(C)(ii).
Accordingly, the Court finds Plaintiff has given absolutely no
notice of his witnesses' possible testimony, and Home Depot
would be prejudiced if the four doctors were allowed to testify
at trial. See Harmon v. Georgia Gulf Lake Charles L.L.C.,
476 F. App'x 31, 37 (5th Cir.2012) (affirming district court's
finding of prejudice where appellants provided “no usable
information” in their initial expert report, deposition was
scheduled several weeks after report deadline, and appellants
failed to provide any opinions as of deadline for disclosure).
3. Possibility of Curing Such a Prejudice by Granting a
Continuance
As an initial matter, the Court recognizes that it vacated the
previously-scheduled trial date in an order dated November
13, 2013. Doc. 75. The case will now proceed to trial, if
necessary, following the Court's ruling on the parties' pending
summary judgment motions. Id.
*5  Since the Court's November 13 order, Plaintiff has failed
to cure the deficiencies identified above with respect to
Drs. Kilgore, Goldings, or Batlle. Plaintiff's supplemental
materials for Dr. Jodoin also fall short of satisfying Rule
26's requirements. Consequently, there is little indication that
granting Plaintiff more time to comply with the Rule would
be beneficial, especially when he has represented to the Court
that materials from his experts “must be propounded via
issuance of a subpoena.” See, e.g., First Am. Exp. Des. 2. It
seems more likely that granting additional time would only
result in additional delay and unnecessary expense for all
involved. Barrett, 95 F.3d at 381 . In addition, more time
would not, “in and of itself,” “ ‘deter future dilatory behavior,
nor serve to enforce local rules or court imposed scheduling
orders.’ ” Id. (quoting Geiserman v. MacDonald,  893 F.2d
787, 792 (5th Cir.1990)). Consequently, the Court finds this
factor also weighs in favor of striking the designation.
4. Importance of the Evidence and Related Witnesses'
Testimony

The Court now considers the fourth and final factor regarding
the importance of the evidence and related witnesses'
testimony. Plaintiff argues that the evidence and testimony
sought to be introduced is “key medical evidence that is
needed to prove this case.” Pl.'s Mot. 2. However, Plaintiff
has failed to explain how this is so. Indeed, the records
he previously provided from Drs. Kilgore and Goldings
are more than two years before the incident, and it is not
clear if these doctors ever saw Plaintiff after 2009 and
2010. Though Drs. Batlle and Jodoin did treat Plaintiff
after the alleged injury at Home Depot, their records are
virtually silent with respect to that specific trauma and
any associated examinations or diagnoses. To be sure, Dr.
Jodoin has provided a letter that states his opinion that the
incident at Home Depot exacerbated Plaintiff's pre-existing
back condition, which is no doubt important to Plaintiff's
case. However, “the importance of such proposed testimony
cannot singularly override the enforcement of local rules and
scheduling orders.” Geiserman, 893 F.2d at 792. “Moreover,
the claimed importance of [Plaintiff's] expert testimony
merely underscores the need for [Plaintiff] to have complied
with the court's deadlines or at least informed the trial judge in
advance if good faith compliance was not possible.” Barrett,
95 F.d at 381.
In conclusion, Plaintiff has not only failed to comply with
Rule 26 , but he has also failed to provide a sufficient
explanation to justify his non-compliance. As Rule 37 makes
clear, “[i]f a party fails to provide information or identify
a witness as required by Rule 26(a) or (e) , the party is not
allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence
on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure was
substantially justified or is harmless .” Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(c)(1).
Based on the filings, relevant law, and its “wide latitude”
in handling pretrial matters, the Court finds that Plaintiff's
disobedience was neither substantially justified nor harmless.
See Campbell v. Keystone Aerial Surveys, Inc.,  138 F.3d
996, 1000 (5th Cir.1998) . The Court therefore GRANTS
Defendant's Motion to Strike Expert Designation.
B. Motion for Leave of Court and First Amended Expert
Witness Designations
*6  The Court now considers Plaintiff's Motion for Leave
of Court to file his First Amended Expert Witness
Designations. As the Court has already discussed, Plaintiff
has failed to adequately explain why he could not comply
with Rule 26 regarding his initial Expert Designation. What's
more, his amended filing also lacks the required disclosures.
Finally, Plaintiff attempts for the first time to designate
an organization (University of Texas Medical Branch), its
doctors, and a physician's assistant as experts, without any
offering explanation or justification for their addition.
In light of the Court's analysis with respect to Defendant's
Motion as well as the deficiencies of Plaintiff's current
request, the Court finds no reason to grant Plaintiff leave
to file his First Amended Expert Witness Designations.
Accordingly, the Court DENIES his Motion.
III.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's Motion to Strike
Plaintiff's Expert Witness Designation is GRANTED.
Accordingly, the Court STRIKES Plaintiff's Expert
Designation, and Plaintiff is prohibited from using the
information or witnesses therein in a motion, at a hearing, or
at trial. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(c)(1). The Court also DENIES
Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to file his First Amended Expert
Witness Designations.
SO ORDERED.
