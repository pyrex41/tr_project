MEMORANDUM ORDER
JANE J. BOYLE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
*1  Before the Court is the “Motion of JMC Construction,
L.P., to Strike the Modular Space Corporation's Summary
Judgment Response and the Supporting Declarations of Paul
Sly and Dan Sharer in Defense of Defendant Modular
Space Corporation's Response to Motion for Summary
Judgment” (doc. 37). After review of the motion and briefing,
and the history of this case, the Motion is GRANTED in part
and DENIED in part.
I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
This declaratory judgment and breach of contract case was
originally filed by JMC Construction, LP (“JMC”) against
Modular Space Corporation (“ModSpace”) on October 16,
2007 in the 116th District Court of Dallas County, Texas.
The dispute revolves around alleged damages to modular
buildings which were the subject of various contracts between
the parties. The case was removed from state court on
November 16, 2007. ModSpace filed its Original Answer on
November 26, 2007. The parties filed a Joint Status Report
on January 11, 2008 in which they estimated discovery would
take six months from entry of a scheduling order. The parties
proposed that “initial disclosures be served no later than 30
days after entry of the pretrial scheduling order by this Court.”
The Court entered a Scheduling Order on January 14, 2008.
According to the Scheduling Order, JMC's expert designation
and report was due April 30, 2008, and ModSpace's expert
designation and report was due May 30, 2008. Discovery was
to be completed by July 31, 2008.
Following an unopposed motion, the Court granted
ModSpace leave to file a Counterclaim, which was filed on
April 8, 2008. After a series of motions and responses, the
Court granted JMC leave to file its First Amended Original
Complaint, which was filed on April 15, 2008. JMC filed
an Answer to Defendant's Counterclaim on April 18, 2008.
ModSpace admits that it did not file an Answer to Plaintiff's
First Amended Original Complaint.
It is clear from the discovery documents provided by
JMC that ModSpace has missed a series of deadlines
in the discovery phase of this case. ModSpace did not
provide the required Rule 26(a) initial disclosures within
the proper deadline, or even within the time period for
discovery, and did not designate any experts. On April 18,
2008, JMC served ModSpace with its First Request for
Production of Documents and first Interrogatories. JMC filed
its Designation of Expert Witness and served its Expert
Report on ModSpace on April 29, 2008. On May 30, 2008,
ModSpace served its Responses and Objections to JMC's
discovery requests. ModSpace provided no documents in
response to JMC's forty-four Requests for Production, but
merely responded to each request that it would “produce
any responsive documents that it can locate.” In response to
an interrogatory asking ModSpace to identify “all persons
having knowledge of any discoverable matters other than
those used to support your claims or defenses[,]” ModSpace
identified only Rodney Strasser. ModSpace identified no
other potential parties to the lawsuit. In response to all other
interrogatory requests, ModSpace provided no information
other than “Defendant will supplement.” The deadline for the
completion of discovery passed on July 31, 2008.
*2  JMC filed a Motion for Final Summary Judgment
(doc. 29) on July 30, 2008 supported by the affidavit of
its designated expert. ModSpace filed its response to JMC's

Motion for Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for Partial
Summary Judgment (doc. 34) on August 21, 2008. In support
of its Response, ModSpace provided declarations of Paul
Sly and Dan Sharer, neither of whom had been disclosed
by ModSpace as persons with knowledge, identified in
ModSpace's discovery responses, or designated as experts.
On August 27, 2008, ModSpace served JMC with its
Initial Disclosures identifying fifteen individuals likely to
have discoverable information, including Paul Sly and Dan
Sharer. On the same day, ModSpace also served JMC with
its First Amended Answers and Objections to Plaintiff's
First Interrogatories and sent JMC various documents and
photographs related to the dispute.
On August 28, 2008, JMC filed its Motion to Strike
ModSpace's Response and the Supporting Declarations of
Paul Sly and Dan Sharer (doc. 37). In this Motion, JMC
provides documentation of ModSpace's conduct in discovery,
including copies of the “initial disclosures” and amended
discovery responses served nearly a month after the close
of discovery. JMC argues that both ModSpace's Response
to JMC's Motion for Final Summary Judgment and the
Declarations of Paul Sly and Dan Sharer should be stricken
based on ModSpace's (1) failure to provide timely initial
disclosures, (2) failure to substantively answer interrogatories
or produce requested documents within the discovery period,
(3) failure to designate Paul Sly and Dan Sharer as
expert witnesses, and (4) failure to answer JMC's amended
complaint.1 On September 5, 2008, JMC filed a Reply to
ModSpace's Response to JMC's Motion for Final Summary
Judgment (doc. 39).
In its Response in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion to Strike
Declarations (doc. 55), ModSpace states that “throughout
litigation, both parties have attempted to put off most
discovery to improve the chances of settlement.” ModSpace
argues the “Scheduling Order did not contain a deadline
for providing Rule 26(a) disclosures,” but admits that the
disclosures were “due within fourteen days of the parties' Rule
16(f) conference, which was prior to the January 14, 2008
Scheduling Order.” ModSpace states that it “failed to docket
the deadline for original disclosures because the deadline was
not included within the Scheduling Order.” ModSpace also
argues that “JMC's [April 28, 2008] disclosures identified
Paul Sly as a person with knowledge of relevant facts.”
ModSpace admits that it did not designate an expert witness
and did not provide disclosure responses identifying Paul
Sly and Dan Sharer as individuals with knowledge until
August 28, 2008. ModSpace also states that due to various
circumstances, it had “difficulty locating documents or
individuals familiar with the project.”
II. APPLICABLE LAW
Under Rule 26(a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
a party must make certain initial disclosures within the early
stages of litigation without awaiting a discovery request.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a). This includes a duty to disclose “each
individual likely to have discoverable information—along
with the subject of that information—that the disclosing party
may use to support its claims or defenses, unless the use
would be solely for impeachment.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)
(A)(i). The rule provides that a “party is not excused from
making its disclosures because it has not fully investigated
the case or because it challenges the sufficiency of another
party's disclosures or because another party has not made its
disclosures.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(E). Further, Rule 26(e)
requires that a “party who has made a disclosure under Rule
26(a)—or who has responded to an interrogatory, request
for production, or request for admission–must supplement or
correct its disclosure response.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e); Mills
v. Beech Aircraft Corp. , 886 F.2d 758, 764 (5th Cir. 1989) .
Supplemental disclosures shall be made “in a timely manner
if the party learns that in some material respect the disclosure
or response is incomplete or incorrect, and if the additional or
corrective information has not otherwise been made known to
the other parties during the discovery process or in writing.”
Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e).
*3  Under Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure ,
a party who fails to provide information or identify a witness
through initial disclosures or proper supplementation of
discovery responses, pursuant to Rule 26(a) and (e) , “is not
allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence
on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure
was substantially justified or is harmless. ” Fed. R. Civ. P.
37(c)(1) (emphasis added); Tex. A & M. Research Found. v.
Magna Transp., Inc., 338 F.3d 394, 401–02 (5th Cir. 2003) ;
Primrose Operating Co. v. Nat'l Am. Ins. Co. , 382 F.3d 546,
563 (5th Cir. 2004). The “sanction of exclusion is automatic
and mandatory unless the sanctioned party can show that
its violation of Rule 26(a) was either justified or harmless.”
David v. Caterpillar, Inc., 324 F.3d 851, 857 (7th Cir. 2003).
In determining whether a violation of Rule 26  is harmless
or substantially justified, the district court's decision is to
be guided by the consideration of four factors: “(1) the

importance of the evidence; (2) the prejudice to the opposing
party of including the evidence; (3) the possibility of curing
such prejudice by granting a continuance; and (4) the
explanation for the party's failure to disclose.” Tex. A &
M, 338 F.3d at 402 ; Paulsen v. State Farm Ins. Co. , No.
06-9546, 2008 WL 449783, at *2 (E.D. La. Feb. 15, 2008) .
A motion to compel is not a prerequisite to the granting of
Rule 37 sanctions. Sierra Club, Lone Star Chapter v. Cedar
Point Oil Co., 73 F.3d 546, 572 (5th Cir. 1996). “If the party
required to make the disclosure would need the material to
support its own contentions, the more effective enforcement
of the disclosure requirement will be to exclude the evidence
not disclosed ...” Id. (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 37  advisory
committee's notes).
III. APPLICATION OF LAW TO FACTS
The Court finds that ModSpace has not complied with
the mandatory Rule 26(a)  initial disclosures, Rule 26(e)
supplementation requirement, or with the deadline for
completion of discovery set by the Court. ModSpace's Rule
26(a) “initial disclosures” were provided twenty-seven days
after the discovery period had ended and more than six
months after they were due. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a) .
During discovery, ModSpace did not provide any documents
in response to requests for production and, in fact, its only
response was a promise to “supplement.” See Fed. R. Civ.
P. 26(e). Then, after the close of discovery and after JMC
had gone through the expense of filing a motion for final
summary judgment, ModSpace responded with affidavits of
two witnesses and exhibits that had never been provided
to JMC. After filing its response, ModSpace served JMC
with its “initial disclosures” and “supplemented” its discovery
responses. The Court finds ModSpace's dubious conduct
during discovery in this case in violation of Rule 26(a)and (e).
In deciding whether Rule 37 sanctions should be imposed,
the Court first looks to whether the failure to provide
timely initial disclosures and discovery supplementation
was substantially justified. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1) . In
attempting to justify its failure to meet deadlines under Rule
26, JMC admits that because the amount in controversy
is “less than $120,000[,]” it had “put off most discovery
to improve the chances of a settlement.” JMC offers the
Court an excuse of failing to calendar the initial disclosure
deadline and explains that there had been “difficulty locating
documents or individuals familiar with the project.” But the
statements made by ModSpace's counsel in its Response in
Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion to Strike Declarations as
justification of its failure to timely disclose and supplement
its discovery responses are unsupported by documentation
or sworn affidavits. More importantly, the Court does not
find the litany of excuses that ModSpace provides to be
“substantial justification” for such a lengthy failure to comply
with mandatory disclosure deadlines and supplementation
requirements.
*4  Turning to the four factors in determining whether
ModSpace's failure to comply with Rule 26(a) and (e)  was
“harmless,” the Court finds ModSpace's failure to timely
disclose witnesses or supplement discovery was not harmless.
See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1) ; Tex. A & M , 338 F.3d at 402 .
Under the first factor, the evidence is very important to
ModSpace's case because it consists of eyewitness testimony
and photographs regarding the condition of the modular
buildings which are the subject of the dispute. Cf. Sierra
Club, 73 F.3d at 573  (finding no abuse of discretion in
excluding testimony that “ultimately proved to be relatively
unimportant.”). However, the importance of the evidence is
not the only factor to be considered.
Under the second factor, the Court notes that JMC would be
highly prejudiced if the Court allowed the evidence because
it cuts to the heart of the case. See Paulsen, 2008 WL 449783,
at *3. JMC had no opportunity to depose these undisclosed
witnesses during discovery and had already moved for
summary judgment based on ModSpace's lack of evidence
to dispute JMC's expert testimony. In its attempt to show
JMC was not prejudiced by the failure to disclose, ModSpace
claims JMC itself had identified Paul Sly as an individual
with knowledge and therefore, could not be prejudiced by
ModSpace's failure to identify him. However, ModSpace has
not provided the Court a copy of JMC's Initial Disclosures as
proof of that claim. Regardless of JMC's alleged awareness
that Paul Sly was an individual with knowledge, it was
unaware that ModSpace intended to use Paul Sly as a fact
witness to support its case since ModSpace had not provided
timely initial disclosures or disclosed him as a witness in its
interrogatory responses. See id. (noting that where a witness
list was filed late, the opposing party's previous awareness of a
witness's affidavit “does not translate into knowledge that [the
witness] was going to be used [by the non-disclosing party]
as a witness[ ]” at trial).
In regard to the third factor, the Court is reluctant to grant
a continuance to cure the prejudice to JMC and allow
ModSpace to benefit from its failure to follow the rules

governing discovery. A continuance “would neither punish
[ModSpace] for its conduct nor deter similar behavior in the
future.” See Sierra Club, 73 F.3d at 573  (quoting Bradley v.
United States, 866 F.2d 120, 126 (5th Cir. 1989) ).
The fourth factor also weighs heavily against ModSpace, as
its explanation for its failure to timely disclose or supplement
discovery falls far short of its goal. ModSpace's position, as
evidenced in filings before this Court, seemed to be that the
“small” monetary amount in dispute did not warrant counsel's
attention to discovery deadlines because the case would
probably settle. This attitude toward mandatory disclosure
rules and the discovery deadline set in the Court's Scheduling
Order is viewed poorly by the courts and does not comport
with the standard expected of lawyers practicing in federal
court. See generally Sierra Club, 73 F.3d at 569–71; Paulsen,
2008 WL 449783, at *3–*5.
In sum, ModSpace's wholesale disregard for the discovery
rules and discovery deadlines in this case provides ample
justification for excluding the evidence ModSpace failed
to bring forth until a month after discovery had closed.
Therefore, pursuant to Rule 37, the Court prohibits ModSpace
from using the testimony of Paul Sly and Dan Sharer at trial
in this case. This evidentiary bar includes the declarations
of Paul Sly and Dan Sharer, as well as the exhibits attached
to those witnesses' declarations, in support of ModSpace's
Response to JMC's Motion for Final Summary Judgment.
IV . CONCLUSION
*5  For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS in part
and DENIES in part  the Motion of JMC Construction,
L.P., to Strike the Modular Space Corporation's Summary
Judgment Response and the Supporting Declarations of Paul
Sly and Dan Sharer (doc. 37). The Court denies the request
to strike the Summary Judgment Response itself, but grants
the request to exclude the evidence offered in support of
ModSpace's Summary Judgment Response. In accordance
with Rule 37(c)(1) for failure to file initial disclosures within
the proper deadlines and supplement discovery responses,
the Court STRIKES the entire Appendix in Support of
Defendant's Response to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary
Judgment (doc. 35), including the declarations of Paul Sly and
Dan Sharer and the exhibits attached to those declarations.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED , for the same reasons state
above and in accordance with Rule 37(c)(1), that all witnesses
which ModSpace failed to disclose or identify in interrogatory
responses prior to July 31, 2008 are STRICKEN from
ModSpace's witness lists and their testimony is EXCLUDED
from trial.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED , for the same reasons
state above and in accordance with Rule 37(c)(1) , that all
documents not disclosed and produced to JMC prior to July
31, 2008 are STRICKEN from ModSpace's exhibit list and
may not be used at trial.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED  that, because Paul Sly and
Dan Sharer are excluded from trial as witnesses for the
reasons stated above, Defendant's Motion for Leave to File
Expert Designations (doc. 57) is DENIED.
Based on the above disposition, Plaintiff's Second Motion
to Strike the Declarations of Paul Sly and Dan Sharer (doc.
40)and Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to File Motion to Exclude
Defendant Modular Space Corporation's Expert Witnesses
at Trial (doc. 46) are MOOT.
SO ORDERED.

1 The Court notes that on September 5, 2008, JMC filed a Second Motion to Strike the Declarations of Paul Sly and Dan
Sharer (doc. 40) on the alternative grounds that the affidavits were not made on personal knowledge and did not set
forth facts that would be admissible evidence. Based on the ruling on JMC's first Motion to Strike, the Court need not
consider this Motion and it is, therefore, moot.
