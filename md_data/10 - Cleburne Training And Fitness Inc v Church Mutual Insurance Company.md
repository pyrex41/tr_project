ORDER
JANE J. BOYLE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
*1  Before the Court is Defendant, Church Mutual
Insurance Company (“Church Mutual”)’s Motion for Leave
to Designate Expert Witness (Doc. 26). For the following
reasons, the Court GRANTS Church Mutual's Motion.
This is a dispute over a property insurance claim by Plaintiffs,
Cleburne Training & Fitness, Inc. and North Nolan Road
Holdings, Inc. (“Cleburne”) for alleged hail damages to a
roof. Doc. 1-4, Pet., ¶ 11. On March 18, 2024, the Court issued
a scheduling order setting the deadline for Defendant's Expert
Designation to August 12, 2024. Doc. 10, Scheduling Order,
1. On July 30, 2024, the parties submitted a Joint Motion for
Continuance. Doc. 24, Mot. Continuance. The Court granted
the Motion and extended Church Mutual's Expert Designation
to September 12, 2024. Doc. 10, Scheduling Order; Doc. 25,
Elec. Order. The trial is set for April 14, 2025; the deadline for
mediation is November 11, 2024; the deadline for discovery
is December 11, 2024; and the deadline for expert objections
is February 9, 2025. Doc. 10, Scheduling Order, 1; Doc. 25,
Elec. Order.
On September 26, 2024, Church Mutual served its Rebuttal
Expert Designation. Doc. 26, Mot. Leave, 5. The designation
included an expert that was designated two weeks after the
deadline. Id. Cleburne objected to the late designation. Id. On
October 4, 2024, Church Mutual filed a Motion for Leave
to Late Designate an Expert. Id. Church Mutual “seeks leave
to late designate expert witness Ronald Dutton, a metal
roof design, fabrication, and installation expert, who will
testify regarding the functionality of the roof in rebuttal
to Plaintiff's expert, Jeffrey Molnar, a Failure Analyst with
Element Materials Technology.” Id., 1. Church Mutual argues
that Dutton's testimony is necessary to establish its defense
that an exclusion provision applies, precluding Cleburne's
claim for a complete roof replacement. Id., 2. The Court
considers Church Mutual's Motion below.
When deciding whether to allow late designation of an
expert witness, four factors guide the court's analysis: “(1)
the explanation for the failure to identify the witness, (2)
the importance of the testimony, (3) the potential prejudice
in allowing the testimony, and (4) the availability of a
continuance to cure such prejudice.” Wright v. Blythe Nelson,
2001 WL 804529, at *2 (N.D. Tex. July 10, 2001) (Fitzwater,
J.) (citing Geiserman v. MacDonald, 893 F.2d 787, 791 (5th
Cir. 1990)). The court considers the four factors holistically
and “does not mechanically count the number of factors
that favor each side.” EEOC v. Serv. Temps, Inc., 2009 WL
3294863, at *3 (N.D. Tex. Oct. 13, 2009)  (Fitzwater, C.J.),
aff'd, 679 F.3d 323 (5th Cir. 2012) . The Court finds all four
factors support granting Church Mutual leave to designate
Dutton as an expert.
The Court finds Church Mutual has good cause for its
delay. Upon receipt of Cleburne's expert disclosures, Church
Mutual retained an engineer and construction specialist as
experts, designating them as such on August 12. Doc. 26,
Mot. Leave, 4. On August 20, the engineer determined he
could not complete his investigation without the opinion of
a metallurgist. Id. On August 30, Church Mutual granted
permission for counsel to retain Dutton, a metallurgist. Id. On
September 17, Cleburne agreed to provide the roof samples,
and on September 24, Dutton received the samples. Id.
Two days later, Church Mutual served its rebuttal expert

designation on Cleburne. Id. The Court finds that Church
Mutual acted as promptly as it could have under the
circumstances.
*2  Cleburne argues that Church Mutual should have known
that it needed to designate a metallurgist much earlier on.
Doc. 27, Pl.’s Reply, 8. However, Church Mutual argues that
typical claim disputes require the opinion of an engineer and
“usually policyholders object to metallurgical testing during
the claim handling process.” Doc. 30, Def.’s Reply, 1–2.
The Court finds Church Mutual's justification persuasive.
Moreover, the Court finds that the other three factors support
granting Church Mutual leave to designate Dutton as an
expert.
Dutton's testimony is critical to Church Mutual's defense
that a policy exclusion applies. As Church Mutual notes,
Cleburne designated a metallurgist who provided an opinion
based on his “microscopic analysis of the roof samples.”
Doc. 30, Def.’s Reply, 3. Church Mutual cannot address this
opinion without designating a metallurgist as an expert. Id.
This testimony is needed to establish whether the hail that hit
the roof caused structural or only cosmetic damages, which
would directly answer whether a policy exclusion applies.
Doc. 26, Mot. Leave, 3.
Cleburne argues that Dutton's testimony cannot be important
because it is “wholly inadmissible.” Doc. 27. Pl.’s Reply, 7.
However, the Court will not consider Daubert factors at this
stage of proceedings. Should Cleburne wish to file expert
objections, it may do so after January 10, 2025, or seek leave
to do so earlier. Doc. 10, Scheduling Order, 3; Doc. 25, Elec.
Order.
The potential prejudice is low, and a continuance can cure
whatever prejudice exists. The deadline for discovery is
December 11, 2024; the deadline to file expert objections is
February 9; 2025, and the trial is not scheduled until April
14, 2025. Doc. 10, Scheduling Order, 1; Doc. 25, Elec. Order.
Allowing Church Mutual leave to designate Dutton as an
expert two weeks past the designation deadline will not cause
prejudice to Cleburne. Cleburne still has plenty of time to
conduct discovery and file Daubert challenges.
Cleburne argues that it will suffer prejudice because it will not
have time to provide a rebuttal report or depose Dutton before
the mediation scheduled for November 8, 2024. Doc. 27, Pl.’s
Reply, 13. It also argues that it would have sought leave to
file early Daubert motions prior to mediation. Id. However,
the Court finds that a continuance for mediation, for which
the parties can move, would cure any potential prejudice and
would not disrupt the other dates set out in the Scheduling
Order. For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Church
Mutual's Motion for Leave (Doc. 26).
SO ORDERED.
