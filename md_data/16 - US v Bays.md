MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
JANE J. BOYLE, District Judge.
*1  Before the Court are Defendant Barry Bays's Motion
to Exclude Testimony of Plaintiff's Expert Jordan Trecki,
Ph.D. (“Dr.Trecki”) and Motion to Exclude Plaintiff's Expert
Michael L. Van Linn, Ph.D. (“Dr. Van Linn”) (docs.177, 178),
both filed on April 1, 2014. For the reasons described in this
order, the Court DENIES these motions.
I.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
This case arises out of an alleged conspiracy to manufacture
and distribute synthetic cannabis products across the country.
On August 23, 2013, a complaint was filed against
Defendant Barry Bays alleging violations of 21 U.S.C.
§§ 841  and 846. Doc. 1, Compl. A federal grand jury
returned a one-count indictment against Defendants Barry
Bays, Samuel Madeley, and David Muise on September
17, 2013, charging the defendants with violating 21 U.S.C.
§ 846  (Conspiracy to Distribute a Controlled Substance
Analogue). Doc. 13, Indictment 1. On January 23, 2014,
Bays and five other defendants were named in a multi-count
superseding indictment charging violations of 21 U.S.C.
§ 846  (Conspiracy to Distribute a Controlled Substance
Analogue). Doc. 117, Second Sup. Indictment 1–2. The
superseding indictment also separately charged Bays with
violating 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c)(1)(A)  and (c)(2) (Possession
of a Firearm in Furtherance of a Drug Trafficking Crime)
and 21 U.S.C. § 843(b) (Using a Communication Facility to
Facilitate a Drug Felony). Id.
On April 1, 2014, Defendant Bays filed both the Motion to
Exclude Dr. Trecki (doc. 177), and the Motion to Exclude
Dr. Van Linn (doc 178). Defendant Bays argues that under
Federal Rules of Evidence 104, 702, and 703 and Daubert v.
Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct.
2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), the opinions of Dr. Van Linn
and Dr. Trecki should be excluded to the extent that they opine
on the substantial similarity of the four chemical substances
identified in the Second Superseding Indictment to schedule I
synthetic cannabinoids.1 Second Sup. Indictment 1–2; Def.'s
Mot. to Excl. Trecki 1; Def.'s Mot. to Excl. Van Linn 1.

LEGAL STANDARD
Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence  provides for
the testimony at trial of an “ expert by knowledge, skill,
experience, training, or education,” if such testimony “will
assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to
determine a fact in issue.” Fed.R.Evid. 702 . Accordingly,
the Court acts as a “gatekeeper” that “may admit proffered
expert testimony only if the proponent, who bears the burden
of proof, demonstrates that (1) the expert is qualified, (2)
the evidence is relevant to the suit, and (3) the evidence
is reliable.” Nunn v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,  No.
3:08–CV–1486–D, 2010 WL 2540754, at *2 (N.D. June 22,
Tex.2010) (citing Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael,  526 U.S.
137, 152, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999)).
Whether an expert is qualified to testify is a question of law.
Mathis v. Exxon Corp.,  302 F.3d 448, 459 (5th Cir.2002)
(citing Fed.R.Evid. 104(a) ). As such, “[b]efore a district
court may allow a witness to testify as an expert, it must
be assured that the proffered witness is qualified to testify
by virtue of his knowledge, skill, experience, training, or
education.' ” Nunn, 2010 WL 2540754, at *2 (quoting United

States v. Cooks,  589 F.3d 173, 179 (5th Cir.2009)  (internal
quotation marks omitted). However, “ Rule 702  does not
mandate that an expert be highly qualified in order to testify
about a given issue.” Huss v. Gayden, 571 F.3d 442, 452 (5th
Cir.2009). Instead, “[d]ifferences in expertise bear chiefly on
the weight to be assigned to the testimony by the trier of
fact, not its admissibility.” Id.; see also Daubert, 509 U.S. at
596 (“Vigorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary
evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof are
the traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but
admissible evidence.”).
*2  “Evidence is relevant if ‘it has any tendency to make
any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the
action more probable or less probable than it would be without
the evidence.’ ” Wellogix, Inc. v. Accenture, L.L.P ., 716 F.3d
867, 882 (5th Cir.2013)  (quoting Fed.R.Evid. 401(a)). Said
differently, expert testimony is relevant when the expert's
“reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the
facts in issue.” Daubert, 509 U.S. at 593 . Conversely, “[e]
xpert testimony which does not relate to any issue in the case
is not relevant and, ergo, non-helpful.” Id. at 591.
Evidence is reliable if “ ‘the reasoning or methodology
underlying the testimony is scientifically valid.’ ” Knight v.
Kirby Inland Marine, Inc., 482 F.3d 347, 352 (5th Cir.2007)
(quoting Daubert, 509 U.S. at 593). To determine whether the
methodology employed by an expert is scientifically valid,
the Court considers five non-exclusive factors: “1) whether
the expert's technique or theory can be or has been tested-
that is, whether the expert's theory can be challenged in some
objective sense, or whether it is instead simply a subjective,
conclusory approach that cannot reasonably be assessed for
reliability; 2) whether the technique or theory has been subject
to peer review and publication; 3) the known or potential
rate of error of the technique or theory when applied; 4) the
existence and maintenance of standards and controls; and 5)
whether the technique or theory has been generally accepted
in the scientific community.” Florer v. Elec. Data Sys. Corp.,
No. 303CV1175H, 2004 WL 1562851, at *3 (N.D.Tex. July
13, 2004).
To be sure, the reliability test is a flexible one that grants
district courts wide discretion, and Daubert' s dictates apply
“not only to testimony based on ‘scientific’ knowledge, but
also to testimony based on ‘technical’ and ‘other specialized’
knowledge.” Kumho Tire, 526 U.S. at 141 . Reliability does
not mean certainty, but more than speculation is required.
Nunn, 2010 WL 2540754, at *2  (citing Daubert, 509 U.S.
at 590). Correspondingly, a court may consider one or more
of the Daubert factors, as well as other factors “ ‘relevant to
the case at hand,’ ” in determining the reliability of proffered
testimony Paz v. Brush Engineered Materials, Inc., 555 F.3d
383, 388 (5th Cir.2009)  (quoting Black v. Food Lion Inc.,
171 F.3d 308, 312 (5th Cir.1999)); see Kumho Tire, 526 U.S.
at 138 (“A trial judge determining the admissibility of an ...
expert's testimony may consider one or more of the specific
Daubert factors.”).
III.
ANALYSIS
The Defendant's Motions to Exclude Expert Testimony are
considered within the context of the Controlled Substance
Analogue Enforcement Act of 1986 (“CSAEA”), which
“Congress enacted ... to keep up with rapidly progressing
drug technologies and to target the distribution of so-called
‘designer drugs.’ ” United State v. Nasir, No. 5:12–CR–102–
JMH, 2013 WL5373619, at *1 (E.D.Ky. Sept. 25, 2013)
(citing United States v. Washam,  312 F.3d 926, 933 (8th
Cir.2002)); 21 U.S.C. § 813. DEA has concluded that each of
the substances at issue-AM2201, 5F–PB–22, PB–22, and 5F–
UR–244 (a .k.a.XLR11)-is a schedule I controlled substance
or controlled substance analogue. 21 C.F.R. § 1308.11(g)-(h);
Doc. 184, Pl.'s Resp. 2. A controlled substance analogue is a
substance:
*3  (i) the chemical structure of which is substantially
similar to the chemical structure of a controlled substance
in schedule I or II;
(ii) which has a stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic
effect on the central nervous system that is substantially
similar or greater than the stimulant, depressant, or
hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system of a
controlled substance in schedule I or II; or
(iii) with respect to a particular person, which such person
represents or intends to have a stimulant, depressant,
or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system
that is substantially similar or greater than the stimulant,
depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous
system of a controlled substance in schedule I or II.
21 U.S.C. § 802(32)(A) . In short, a chemical substance
must be “substantially similar” to a controlled substance in
schedule I or II. Defendant notes that “ ‘substantially similar’

## Page 3

is not a scientific concept,' ” and that “the analogue act does
not indicate that the term ‘substantially similar’ is to be
defined in any scientific sense.” Def.'s Mot. to Excl. Trecki
2–3 (quoting Anacker & Imwinkelried, Controlled Substance
Analogue Enforcement Act Criminal Defense,  37 SW. U.L.
REV . 267, 295 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).
The Court agrees. Indeed, “there is no indication that
Congress intended the words ‘substantially similar’ to have
a specialized or scientific meaning.” United States v. Reece,
No. 12–00146, 2013 WL 3865067, at *9 (W.D.La. July
24, 2013) . “Therefore, these words should be given their
ordinary meanings.”  Id.; see also United States v. Brown, 279
F.Supp.2d 1238, 1240–41 (S.D.Ala.2003),aff'd 415 F.3d 1257
(11th Cir.2005) (“Since the Analogue Act does not indicate
that the term ‘substantially similar’ is to be defined as it is
used scientifically, the court will interpret those words as
they are used in everyday language.”). Under this construct,
“substantially similar” is read “as having ‘essential elements
in common.’ ” Alemeda Mall, L.P . v. Shoe Show, Inc., 649
F.3d 389, 392 (5th Cir.2011) (citing Random House Webster's
College Dictionary (2d ed.1999)) (defining “substantially
similar” in a trade-name dispute). Accordingly, Defendant
asserts that Dr. Van Linn and Dr. Trecki are unfit to testify as
to whether AM2201, PB–22, and 5F–UR–144 (a.k.a.XLR11)
have essential elements in common with JWH–018, and
whether 5F–PB–22 has essential elements in common with
AM2201. Def's Mot. to Excl. Trecki; Def.'s Mot. to Excl. Van
Linn.
A. Van Linn
1. Qualifications
Defendant first complains that Dr. Van Linn, due to his
embrace of flawed methodologies, is unqualified to offer
expert testimony. Doc. 190, Def.'s Reply 2.
The Government, in contrast, offers an extensive list of
accomplishments to showcase Dr. Van Linn's pedigree:
employment as a forensic chemist in DEA's Office of
Diversion Control (ODE), Drug and Chemical Evaluation
Section, since September 2013; previous work as a forensic
chemist with DEA's North Central Laboratory in Chicago,
Illinois, and as a research scientist at Cambridge Major
Laboratories in Germantown, Wisconsin; and numerous past
positions in academia, including a post-doctoral fellowship.
Pl.'s Resp. 4. In addition, Dr. Van Linn is the co-author almost
twenty peer-reviewed articles and has received awards for
outstanding work. Id.
*4  Defendant's contention that Dr. Van Linn's methods
somehow render him unqualified to testify as an expert
is misguided. As previously noted, an expert witness
may be qualified based upon his “knowledge, skill,
experience, training, or education.” Fed.R.Evid. 702. Absent
from the list of qualifying factors is subscription to
any certain methodology or principle, which is instead
considered by the reliability prong. Fed.R.Evid. 702(c) ;
see also Knight, 482 F.3d at 352 . While an expert's
qualifications and the reliability of his methodology may
be related, they are not dependent upon one another.
Engenium Solutions, Inc. v. Symphonic Technologies, Inc.,
924 F.Supp.2d 757, 770–71 (S.D.Tex.2013) (finding experts
qualified but subsequently excluding their testimony after
considering their methodology under the reliability prong).
Qualified experts sometimes employ unreliable methods and
unqualified experts sometimes employ reliable methods.
Here, Dr. Van Linn's methodology does not diminish his
qualification as an expert. Dr. Van Linn's advanced degree,
work history as a forensic chemist, and previous experience in
academia leave the Court little doubt that he has “specialized
knowledge [that] will help the trier of fact to understand the
evidence,” and is therefore qualified under the factors set
out by Rule 702 to testify as an expert witness. Fed.R.Evid.
702(a).
2. Relevance
Defendant next attacks the relevance of Dr. Van Linn's
testimony under Federal Rules of Evidence 702  and 402.
Def.'s Reply 2. Dr. Van Linn's opinion is irrelevant, Defendant
contends, because the Government failed to provide any
evidence of the sound chemistry required to determine
substantial similarity. Id.
In response, the Government argues that Dr. Van Linn
applied sound methods and principles to the facts of the
case while analyzing the degree of similarity between: (1)
AM2201, PB–22, and 5F–UR–144 (a.k.a.XLR11)and JWH–
018; and (2) 5F–PB–22 and AM2201. Pl .'s Resp. 4. More
specifically, Dr. Van Linn correctly relied on two-dimensional
renderings and knowledge obtained from reviewing current
scientific literature and chemistry information to compare the
structural components of each substance, the chemical class
of the substances by determining their core structure, and the
differences between each substance. Id.

a. Federal Rule of Evidence 702
As stated above, expert testimony is relevant when the
expert's “reasoning or methodology properly can be applied
to the facts in issue.” Daubert, 509 U.S. at 593 . Here, the
facts in issue turn on the question of substantial similarity.
See, e.g., United States v. Bamberg,  478 F.3d 934, 939
(8th Cir.2007); Brown, 415 F.3d at 1264; Reece, 2013 WL
3865067, at *5 n. 21 . The Fifth Circuit has explained “that
drugs which have been chemically designed to be similar to
controlled substances, but which are not themselves listed
on the controlled substances schedules, will nonetheless
be considered as schedule I substances” if they meet the
substantial similarity requirements set forth in § 802(32)
(A). United States v. Granberry,  916 F.2d 1008, 1010 (5th
Cir.1990). There is some question, however, as to what those
requirements are.
*5  As the old adage instructs, the devil is in the details-
the relevant detail here being the single word “or” between
clauses (ii) and (iii) of the definition. There are two possible
readings of the definition. Under a disjunctive reading,
a substance that satisfies any one  of the[ ] three criteria
qualifies as a controlled substance analogue. Under a
conjunctive reading, the provision requires two things: (1)
[t]he substance in question must have a chemical structure
substantially similar to a controlled substance (criterion
one) and (2) it must either have a substantially similar [or
greater] effect on the central nervous system (criterion two)
or be purported or intended to have such an effect (criterion
three).
United States v. Turcotte, 405 F.3d 515, 521 (7th Cir.2005) .
Defendant correctly notes that a majority of courts interpret
the elements of § 802(32)(A)  conjunctively, as opposed to
disjunctively .2 Def.'s Mot. to Excl. Van Linn 2 n. 3; see also
Reece, 2013 WL 3865067, at *7 n. 31.3 The manner in which
the Government presents its experts suggests that it, too,
endorses a conjunctive interpretation. See Pl.'s Resp. 3–7. The
Fifth Circuit also seems to favor a conjunctive reading and,
although it “has not yet expressly weighed on which method
of interpretation should be employed ..., [it has] paraphrased
the definition in a way that is consistent with a conjunctive
interpretation ... [and can be read] as implicitly adopting a
conjunctive reading of the statute.” Reece, 2013 WL 3865067,
at *7 (citing Granberry, 916 F.2d at 1010).
While the Court tends to agree that a conjunctive reading
is preferable, such determination is unnecessary to reach a
decision on relevancy. Here, it is quite clear that Dr. Van
Linn's reasoning and methodology can properly be applied
to the facts in issue. Satisfaction of the chemical structure
criterion of § 802(32)(A) is sufficient for substantial similarity
under a disjunctive reading and necessary for substantial
similarity under a conjunctive reading. See Turcotte, 405 F.3d
at 521 . In other words, an expert's opinion on chemistry
directly relates to an integral issue on the case: whether the
chemical structure of the compounds identified in the Second
and Third Superseding Indictments is substantially similar
to that of schedule I synthetic cannabinoids. Accordingly,
Dr. Van Linn, a chemist, is anticipated to offer testimony
that will “assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence
or to determine a fact in issue.” Daubert, 509 U.S. at 589;
Pl.'s Resp. 3–5. The Court therefore concludes that the expert
opinion of Dr. Van Linn is relevant under the standards set
forth by Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and Daubert.
b. Federal Rule of Evidence 402
Defendant also asserts that the testimony of Dr. Van Linn
should be excluded as irrelevant pursuant to Federal Rule of
Evidence Rule 402. Def.'s Reply 2.
Rule 402 functions as a liberal, baseline standard of relevance
for all testimony, not just that of experts, and is less rigorous
than Rule 702 and Daubert. 509 U.S. at 587. Under Rule 402,
relevant evidence “is admissible unless otherwise provided
by federal statutory or constitutional law, the Federal Rules
of Evidence, or ‘other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court
pursuant to statutory authority.’ ” United States v. Perez–Solis,
709 F.3d 453, 464 (5th Cir.2013)  (citing Fed.R.Evid. 402).
This standard grants district courts “broad discretion in ruling
on questions of relevancy.” United States v. Waldrip, 981 F.2d
799, 806 (5th Cir.1993). “The burden is on the party opposed
to admission of evidence to show a reason for its exclusion.”
United States v. D.K.G. Appaloosas, Inc., 630 F.Supp. 1540,
1562 (E.D.Tex.1986).
*6  As previously discussed, the expert opinion of Dr. Van
Linn is relevant under the standard set forth in Rule 702 .
Testimony that is relevant under the high bar set by Rule
702's expert standard is also relevant under the lower bar set
by Rule 402 's baseline standard. See Bocanegra v. Vicmar
Servs., Inc., 320 F.3d 581, 584 (5th Cir.2003)  (“The expert
testimony must be relevant, not simply in the sense that
all testimony must be relevant [under] Fed.R.Evid. 402, but
also in the sense that the expert's proposed opinion would
assist the trier of fact to understand or determine a fact in
issue.”). Further, Defendant failed to identify any authority
that might preclude Dr. Van Linn from offering testimony.

More precisely, Defendant cited to no authority whatsoever.
Instead, Defendant offered only conclusory allegations of
irrelevancy in support of his argument for exclusion. Def.'s
Reply 2. The Court therefore determines that Defendant failed
to satisfy his burden, and consequently concludes that Dr. Van
Linn's testimony is relevant under Rule 402.
3. Reliability
Defendant next turns to the reliability of Dr. Van Linn's
expected testimony, which is as follows:
1. In comparing the chemical structures for 5F–PB–22 and
AM2201, the difference in chemical structures is minor and
insignificant given that it consists of only a single atom
substitution and an addition of a single atom. Therefore,
5F–PB–22 is substantially similar in chemical structure to
AM2201, a schedule I controlled substance.4
2. In comparing the chemical structures for AM2201 and
JWH–018, the difference in chemical structure is minor and
insignificant given that it consists of only a single atom
substitution. Therefore, AM2201 is substantially similar in
chemical structure to JWH–018, a schedule I controlled
substance.
3. In comparing the chemical structures for PB–22 and
JWH–018, the difference in chemical structure is minor
and insignificant given that it consists only of a single
atom substitution and an addition of a single atom.
Therefore, PB–22 is substantially similar in chemical
structure to JWH–018, a schedule I controlled substance.
4. In comparing the chemical structures for 5F–UR–
144 (a.k.a.XLR11) and JWH–018, the difference in
chemical structure is minor and insignificant given that
it consists only of a change in the peripheral ring system
and a single atom substitution. Therefore, 5F–UR–
144 (a.k.a.XLR11) is substantially similar in chemical
structure to JWH–018, a schedule I controlled substance.
Def.'s Mot. to Excl. Van Linn, Exs. 1–4.
a. Idiosyncratic Comparison Under An Unscientific
Standard
Defendant first contends that Dr. Van Linn's testimony,
purportedly based on a review of current scientific literature
and chemistry information, constitutes mere idiosyncratic
comparison instead of scientific opinion. Def.'s Mot.
to Excl. Van Linn 5–6. Dr. Van Linn's opinion is
unreliably inconsistent, Defendant says, because he finds
different chemicals substantially similar for different reasons.
Defendant goes on to posit that, even if Dr. Van Linn's
opinion were consistent, it would still be nothing more than an
idiosyncratic comparison of two chemicals because there is
no scientific method to determine analogues. Def.'s Reply 6.
*7  In response, the Government argues that courts have
accepted DEA, and specifically ODE, opinions on analogues
and their underlying methodology for decades. Further,
Defendant's reasoning is flawed because he attacks Dr. Van
Linn's conclusions, whereas the Court's sole focus should be
an expert's principles and methodologies. Pl.'s Resp. 11, 13.
The Court finds Defendant's argument that there is
no acceptable method to determine substantial similarity
wanting, and agrees with the Government that DEA opinions
and methodology are widely accepted by courts. See United
States v. Makkar, No. 13–CR–0205–CVE, 2014 WL 1385298,
at *3 (N.D.Okla. Apr.9, 2014)  (noting that the DEA
“comparison of chemical substances are not novel scientific
issues” and denying defendant's request to exclude Dr. Van
Linn's expert testimony on substantial similarity between
JWH–018 and XLR11). If there were no scientific or expert
method to determine analogues, then expert testimony would
be a moot point for both sides. Reality shows otherwise. See
Doc. 108, Def.'s Mot. to Appoint Expert.
Defendant's attack on Dr. Van Linn's methodology by
virtue of his conclusions and their underlying rationale is
similarly unpersuasive. Defendant maintains that Dr. Van
Linn's methods are unreliable because a majority of scientists
believe that UR–144 (a.k.a.XLR11) is not substantially
similar in chemical structure to JWH–018, and that the
addition of an atom precludes between two chemicals from
being substantially similar. Def.'s Mot. to Excl. Van Linn 6–7;
see also The Smoke Shop, LLC v. United States, 949 F.Supp.2d
877, 879 (E.D.Wisc.2013)  “[T]he overwhelming weight of
opinion in the scientific community is that the chemical
structure of UR–144 and XLR–11 are not substantially similar
to the chemical structure of JWH–018 ....”). Defendant is
correct that, in some cases, an expert's conclusions can
affect the reliability of his testimony. See General Elec. Co.
v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 146, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d
508 (1997)  (explaining that methodology and conclusions
are not entirely divorced, and that courts may exclude
expert testimony where there is “too great an analytical gap
between the data and the opinion proffered.”); Fed.R.Evid.
702 advisory committee's note (“[W]hen an expert purports to
apply principles and methods in accordance with professional

standards, and yet reaches a conclusion that other experts in
the field would not reach, the trial court may fairly suspect that
the principles and methods have not been faithfully applied.”)
(citing Lust v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,  89 F.3d
594, 598 (9th Cir.1996). Defendant's position that this is one
of those cases, however, is unfounded.
First, the authority Defendant relies upon, The Smoke Shop,
has been criticized by numerous courts. See, e.g., United
States v. Riley,  No. 2:12–CR–00478–JAD–UCF, 2014 WL
537013, at *5–6 (D.Nev. Feb.7, 2014)  (explaining that the
court was reluctant to give merit to any scientific opinions
expressed in The Smoke Shop  due to a lack of reasoning
for its conclusion); United States v. Carlson,  No. 12–CR–
305 (DSD/LIB), 2013 WL 5125434, at *30 n. 33 (D.Minn.
Sept.12, 2013) (“The Court [in The Smoke Shop  ] made no
holding that UR–144 and XLR11 are not controlled substance
analogues as a matter of law.”). Second, there is no one
avenue that an expert must take to determine whether two
chemical compounds are substantially similar. See United
States v. Ansaldi, 372 F.3d 118, 123–24 (2d Cir.2004) (finding
substantial similarity when there was a three atom difference);
Roberts, 363 F.3d at 124–27 (finding substantial similarity
when there was a two atom difference and the substance
turned into the controlled substance when ingested); Pl.'s
Resp., Ex. A Reinhold Depo. at 41:14–16 (“[O]ne atom
switched out is the most specific definition of an analogue
that I can find ....”). Finally, while trial courts may have
cause to suspect expect testimony that arrives at an outlying
conclusion, such conclusions are by no means automatically
unreliable. See Fed.R.Evid. 702 advisory committee's note;
see also Riley, 2014 WL 537013, at *5.
*8  After considering the standards accepted by other courts,
it is hardly an analytical leap to find, in this context, that
two chemical compounds are substantially similar based on
the addition of one atom. As such, the Court concludes that
Dr. Van Linn's conclusions are not per se unreasonable so as
to render his opinion unreliable. If Defendant has evidence
establishing that such changes substantially alter the chemical
structure of the compounds in question, that evidence can
be presented at trial to discredit Van Linn's conclusions. See
United States v. 14.38 Acres of Land, More or Less Situated
in Leflore County, 80 F.3d 1074, 1077 (5th Cir.1996).
b. Two–Dimensional Modeling
Defendant next attacks Dr. Van Linn's use of two-dimensional
modeling to establish the substantial similarity of two
chemical compounds. Def.'s Reply 3–4. This method is
unreliable, Defendant says, due to statements made by
Lindsey Reinhold in an evidentiary exhibit submitted by
the Government. In particular, Ms. Reinhold stated that “it
is important to look at both two dimensional and three
dimensional structures” in comparing chemical structure, and
that every finding of substantial similarity is a matter of each
chemist's opinion. Pl.'s Resp., Ex. A Reinhold Depo. at 34:12–
23.
In reply, the Government asserts that two-dimensional
structures are the primary manner in which chemists
communicate, as reflected in many peer-related journals,
and have been expressly approved by both the scientific
community and courts. Pl.'s Resp. 11. Further, Ms. Reinhold
agreed that, based on DEA's use of two-dimensional
structures, she would concur that AM2201 was substantially
similar to JWH–018.5 Id., Ex. A Reinhold Depo. at 41:5–19.
Here, too, the Court agrees with the Government that two-
dimensional modeling is a reliable method of comparing
the chemical structure of two compounds. Ms. Reinhold
stated in her deposition that, when comparing two chemical
compounds, two-dimensional models were useful for
determining core structure and three-dimensional models
were useful in identifying attached functional groups to see
how they are similar. Pl.'s Resp., Ex. A Reinhold Depo. at
34:18–23. Ms. Reinhold continued to say that, based on these
considerations, she felt comfortable identifying AM2201 as
an analogue of JWH–018 “with the understanding that there
are chemists out there that my disagree with [her].” Id. at
41:17–19.
Defendant misapprehends Ms. Reinhold's statement that
other experts may disagree with her opinion to mean that
two-dimensional modeling is an unreliable method. Def.'s
Reply 3–4. As previously discussed, substantial similarity
is not a scientific question and there is no requirement that
experts agree on its exact definition. See Carlson, 2013
WL 5125434, at *26  (“[Defendant's] argument regarding a
lack of consensus of a definition of ‘substantially similar’
in the chemistry community overlooks the fact ... that the
question of whether a substance is substantially similar to
another substance is not a scientific question and looks
beyond the mere physical properties of a substance.”); United
States v. Fedida, 942 F.Supp.2d 1270, 1279 (M.D.Fla.2013)
(“[T]he Government need not overcome the critical eye of
chemists and other experts ... [r] ather, it must merely show
that ordinary people would be able to determine whether
[the substances in question] are proscribed analogues of [a

## Page 7

U.S. v. Bays, Not Reported in F.Supp.3d (2014)
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 7
schedule I or II controlled substance].”). While Ms. Reinhold
may determine that a three-dimensional model is appropriate,
other experts, like Dr. Van Linn, may decide to rely solely on
a two-dimensional model. In any event, determining which
approach is best is not this Court's charge. See Ruize–Troche v.
Pepsi–Cola of P .R., 161 F.3d 77, 85 (1st Cir.1998) (“Daubert
neither requires nor empowers trial courts to determine
which of several competing scientific theories has the best
provenance.”).
*9  Accordingly, the Court concludes that two-dimensional
modeling is not an inherently unreliable method of comparing
the chemical structure of two compounds. See Brown, 415
F.3d at 1267  (affirming trial court's admission of expert
testimony on chemical structure in controlled substance
analogue case based solely on visual assessment of a two-
dimensional model even though it “only met one of the four
Daubert factors.”); Moore v. Ashland Chem. ., Inc., 151 F.3d
269, 276 (5th Cir.1998)  (“The proponent need not prove to
the judge that the expert's testimony is correct, but [he] must
prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the testimony
is reliable.”).
c. Lack Of Peer Review and Reliance on Unpublished
Studies
Finally, Defendant criticizes Dr. Van Linn's failure to cite
to peer-reviewed studies and questions his reliance on
unpublished studies, arguing that they give no insight into
how he formed his conclusions or analyzed the chemicals
to determine if they were substantially similar. Def.'s Mot.
to Excl. Van Linn 6.; Def.'s Reply. 2. Defendant goes on to
erroneously argue that the Fifth Circuit has altogether rejected
the notion that expert opinions can be based on unpublished
studies.6 In response, the Government states that, due to
the changing nature of the “designer” drug marker, often
times there is little or no peer-reviewed literature specific to
particular substances, and contends that publication is not an
essential requirement of admissibility or reliability. Pl.'s Resp.
9.
Again, the Court agrees with the Government that Defendant's
concerns regarding Dr. Van Linn's use of unpublished
scientific studies go to the weight of the evidence rather than
the admissibility of his opinions. Viterbo v. Dow Chem. Co.,
826 F.2d 420, 422 (5th Cir.1987). Peerreview, while helpful,
is not itself determinative of reliability. See Roman v. W.
Mfg., Inc., 691 F.3d 686, 694 (5th Cir.2012)  (“The absence
of textual support or published studies is not dispositive
when reliable methods are used.”); Knight, 482 F.3d at
354–55 (explaining that there is no bright-line standard
requiring publication or peer review, and that a lack of textual
support goes to the weight of an expert's testimony, not
its admissibility). Similarly, “[p]ublication (which is but one
element of peer review) is not a sine qua non of admissibility;
it does not necessarily correlate with reliability, and in some
instances well-grounded but innovative theories will not have
been published.” Daubert, 509 U.S. at 593 (internal citations
omitted). Given the rapid developments and fluctuating
landscape of the “designer” drug market, the Court concludes
that Dr. Van Linn's use of unpublished scientific studies when
evaluating the chemical structure of the substances in this case
does not make his opinion intrinsically unreliable. As such,
the exclusion of the whole of Dr. Van Linn's testimony is
inappropriate at this time.
B. Trecki
1. Qualifications
*10  Defendant next attacks the admissibility of the
Government's pharmacological expert, Dr. Trecki. Defendant
argues that Dr. Trecki is unqualified to render expert
testimony due to his embrace of flawed methodologies. Def.'s
Reply 2.
In response, the Government contends that Dr. Trecki,
a pharmacologist in DEA's ODE, Drug and Chemical
Evaluation Section since 2012, regularly monitors, evaluates,
and recommends emerging drugs for scheduling under the
Controlled Substances Act, and lends his scientific opinion
regarding drugs of abuse to local, state, and federal agencies.
Pl.'s Resp. 5. Additionally, Dr. Trecki has previous work
experience as neuropharmacologist and neurotoxicologist
at the Environmental Protection Agency, has served as
an adjunct professor and held a post-doctoral fellowship,
coauthored peer-reviewed articles, and given presentations to
scientific societies. Id. at 5–6.
The Government also states that Dr. Trecki has already been
qualified as an expert and provided similar testimony in
other federal courts.7 Id. Defendant counters by arguing that
he lacks access to Dr. Trecki's previously admitted testimony.
Def.'s Reply 5–6.
As previously discussed, “an expert witness may be qualified
based upon his “knowledge, skill, experience, training, or
education,” but not by his embrace of a certain method
or principle. See Fed.R.Evid. 702(a) ; Knight, 482 F.3d at

## Page 8

U.S. v. Bays, Not Reported in F.Supp.3d (2014)
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 8
352; Engenium Solutions,  924 F.Supp.2d at 770–71 . Here,
even if the court were to disregard Dr. Trecki's previous
testimony, he would still qualify as an expert based on his
current and previous work experience, history in academia,
and expertise in scheduling under the Controlled Substance
Act. See McNamara v. Bre–X Minerals, Ltd., No. 5:97–CV–
159, 2002 WL 32076175, at *4 (E.D.Tex. Sept.30, 2002)
(finding the witness's education and experience qualified him
as an expert even though he lacked trial experience in the area
of testimony.) As such, the Court concludes that, under the
factors set out by Rule 702, Dr. Trecki is qualified to testify
as an expert witness. See Fed.R.Evid. 702(a).
2. Relevance
Defendant next challenges the relevance of Dr. Trecki's
opinion under Federal Rules of Evidence 402  and 702,
alleging that the Government failed to show the sound
pharmacology necessary to determine substantial similarity.
Def.'s Reply 2. In response, the Government argues that Dr.
Trecki applied sound methods and principles to the facts of
the case while analyzing: (1) the degree of similarity between
AM2201, PB–22, and 5F–UR–144 (a.k.a.XLR11) and JWH–
018; and (2) 5F–PB–22 and AM2201. Pl.'s Resp. 6. More
specifically, Dr. Trecki correctly relied on data from in vitro
receptor binding and functional studies, data from in vivo
studies in animals, and scientific literature from National
Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) studies. Id.
As discussed above, expert testimony is relevant when the
expert's “reasoning or methodology properly can be applied
to the facts in issue.” See Daubert, 509 U.S. at 593 . The
facts currently in issue turn on the question of substantial
similarity. See Reece, 2013 WL 3865067, at *5 n. 21 . Here,
as with the testimony of Dr. Van Linn, there is little question
that Dr. Trecki's reasoning and methodology apply directly
to the issue at hand. See supra p. 9. Satisfaction of one
of the two pharmacological criterion of § 802(32)(A)  is
sufficient for substantial similarity under a disjunctive reading
and necessary for substantial similarity under a conjunctive
reading. Id.; see also Turcotte, 405 F.3d at 521. Accordingly,
Dr. Trecki, a pharmacologist, is anticipated to offer testimony
that will “assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence
or to determine a fact in issue.” Daubert, 509 U.S. at 589;
Pl.'s Resp. 5–7. The Court therefore determines that the expert
opinion of Dr. Trecki is relevant under the standards set forth
by Rule 702 and Daubert. As the high bar is met, so too is the
low. Correspondingly, the Court finds Dr. Trecki's testimony
relevant under Rule 402 based on the logic set forth above.
See Bocanegra, 320 F.3d at 584.
3. Reliability
*11  Defendant next turns to the reliability of Dr. Trecki's
expected testimony, which is as follows:
1. AM2201 has a cannabinoid-like pharmacological effect
on the central nervous system that is substantially similar to
the cannabinoid-like pharmacological effects on the central
nervous system as JWH–018, a schedule I controlled
substance.
2. 5F–PB–22 has a cannabinoid-like pharmacological
effect on the central nervous system that is substantially
similar to the cannabinoid-like pharmacological effects
on the central nervous system as AM2201, a schedule I
controlled substance.
3. PB–22 has a cannabinoid-like pharmacological effect on
the central nervous system that is substantially similar to
the cannabinoid-like pharmacological effects on the central
nervous system as JWH–018, a schedule I controlled
substance.
4. XLR11 has a cannabinoid-like pharmacological effect
on the central nervous system that is substantially similar to
the cannabinoid-like pharmacological effects on the central
nervous system as JWH–018, a schedule I controlled
substance.
Def.'s Mot. to Excl. Trecki, Exs. 1–4.
a. Lack Of Peer Review and Reliance on Unpublished
Studies
Defendant first complains that Dr. Trecki's opinion is
unreliable because it is based, in part, on studies that are not
publically available, have not been provided to the defense,
cannot be tested or empirically verified by the scientific
community, and are not admissible under Federal Rule of
Evidence 703. Def.'s Mot. to Excl. Trecki 5; Def.'s Reply 2–
3. In particular, Defendant alleges that Dr. Trecki improperly
relied on confidential NIDA reports.
The Government, meanwhile, contends that there is no legal
requirement for an expert to cite only to published articles
in formulating opinions, and points out that NIDA, a leader
in the field of drug research for decades, relies upon well-
founded scientific principles and methodologies. Pl.'s Resp.
12. Further, Dr. Trecki's opinion is based on studies conducted
by qualified individuals in the scientific community whose

## Page 9

U.S. v. Bays, Not Reported in F.Supp.3d (2014)
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 9
work has been internally peer-reviewed but has yet to be
published publically. Id. at 10.
The Court agrees with the Government that this matter
is appropriately dealt with by crossexamination than by
exclusion. See 14.38 Acres of Land, 80 F.3d at 1077.
For starters, Defendant's assertion that the Government
incorrectly relied upon confidential NIDA research is
mistaken.8 Def.'s Mot. to Excl. Trecki 5. First, Defendant
fails to provide the Court appropriate criteria with which
to review his argument. A Request for Proposal (“RFP”) is
a requisite step to entering into a NIDA research contract.
Because each NIDA contract is unique, different RFPs have
different confidentiality requirements and statements of work.
See NIDA Requests for Contract Proposals (RFPs), National
Institute on Drug Abuse, http://www.drugabuse.gov/fun ding/
funding-opportunities/nida-requests-contract -proposals-rfps
(revised July 2014) (listing active RFPs with different
confidentiality levels and requirements). Accordingly, it is
incorrect to assume that the dictates of one flow uniformly to
another. Here, the Court lacks an applicable standard because,
even though Defendant based his argument on an RFP's
confidentiality requirements, Dr. Trecki never used that RFP
or its subsequent research contract in forming any of his
submitted opinions. See Def.'s Mot. to Excl. Trecki, Exs. 1–5.
*12  Second, even if the confidentiality requirements in
Defendant's proffered RFP were universal, Defendant fails to
show that the research in question would be confidential or
that he would otherwise be unable to access to it. Indeed, the
main purpose of the confidentiality requirement is to protect
private sources' proprietary information. Pl.'s Mot. to Excl.
Trecki, Ex. 5 at 4. Consequently, “it is likely that NIDA will
approve publication by the Contractor of data generated on ...
non-proprietary compounds.” Id. As there is no indication that
Dr. Trecki relied upon proprietary information, Defendant
should be able to gain access to any research which Dr. Trecki
used in forming his opinions because “if the Government
allows use of the data for any purpose other than direct
contract performance, it will be made available for release to
any interested party.” Id. at 18.
Third, other courts have permitted experts to offer opinions
based, in part, on NIDA research when testifying as to
the substantial similarity of a chemical compound to a
controlled substance. See Makkar, 2014 WL 1385298, at *3
(allowing DEA expert witness on pharmacology to review
studies conducted by NIDA on synthetic cannabinoids during
controlled substance analogue proceeding). As such, the
Court determines that Dr. Trecki's reliance on unpublished
NIDA research is permissible and does not render his expert
opinion unreliable.
In addition, Defendant offers nothing more than a conclusory
statement to support his contention that Dr. Trecki's methods
cannot be tested or empirically verified by the scientific
community. Def.'s Mot. to Excl. Trecki 5. The Court's focus
is on an expert's methods and principles, not the conclusions
they generate. See Joiner, 522 U.S. at 146. While the studies
referenced by Dr. Trecki may be unpublished, the Court
agrees that the methodologies that he and NIDA employed
are well known and can be cross-checked and examined
by Defendant. See Daubert, 509 U.S. 593 (explaining that
publication is not a not a sine qua non  of admissibility or
reliability); Knight, 482 F.3d at 354 (internal quotation marks
omitted) (“Where an expert other reliably utilizes scientific
method to reach a conclusion, lack of textual support may
go to the weight, not the admissibility of the expert's
testimony.”).
Finally, Defendant has not sufficiently undermined the
reliability of Dr. Trecki's reliance on unpublished studies so
as to preclude admission of his opinion under Federal Rule
of Evidence 703. Experts may rely on otherwise inadmissible
facts or data “[i]f experts in the particular field would
reasonably rely on those kinds of facts or data in forming an
opinion on the subject.” Fed.R.Evid. 703. The Court finds that
the Government has sufficiently demonstrated that experts
would rely on unpublished NIDA research or internally peer-
reviewed given the quickly evolving and fluid nature of
drug analogue cases. Pl.'s Resp. 9–10, 13–14. Therefore,
the Court concludes that Dr. Trecki's opinion is admissible
under Rule 703. See Brown, 415 F.3d at 1268  (“This means
that expert testimony that does not meet all or most of the
Daubert factors may sometimes be admissible.”); Makkar,
2014 WL 1385298, at *3 . If Defendant wishes to test or
otherwise challenge Dr. Trecki's testimony or the underlying
bases for his opinion, he may do so at trial with forceful
crossexamination and the presentation of contrary evidence.
Viterbo, 826 F.2d at 422 (“As a general rule, questions relating
to the bases and sources of an expert's opinion affect the
weight to be assigned that opinion rather than its admissibility
and should be left for the jury's consideration.”).
b. Studies Conducted Specifically In Anticipation of
Litigation

## Page 10

U.S. v. Bays, Not Reported in F.Supp.3d (2014)
 © 2025 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 10
*13  Defendant next complains that the studies Dr. Trecki
relied upon were not conducted as part of his normal research,
but specifically in anticipation of litigation. Def.'s Mot. to
Excl. Trecki 6. Defendant points to the studies' short time-
frame to support his position. Id. In response, the Government
contends that Dr. Trecki did carry out the studies as part of
his occupational duties, and that the cramped time-frame is
due to dynamic landscape of the “designer” drug market. Pl.'s
Resp. 11.
Once more, the Court agrees with the Government.
See Simpson v. Quarterman,  593 F.Supp.2d 922, 937
(E.D.Tex.2009) (“Finders of fact are cautioned to consider
the possible bias of an expert witness ‘including any bias
you may infer from evidence that the expert witness has
been or will be paid for reviewing the case and testifying, or
from evidence that he testifies regularly as an expert witness
and his income from such testimony represents a significant
portion of his income.”) (quoting Fifth Circuit Pattern
Jury Instructions–Civil Cases, Pattern Instruction 2.19, pg.
23 (2006); Daubert, 43 F.3d 1311, 1317 (9th Cir.1995)
(explaining that court should consider “whether the experts
are proposing to testify about matters growing naturally and
directly out of research they have conducted independent of
the litigation, or whether they have developed their opinions
expressly for purposes of testifying.”). Although the time-
frame in which Dr. Trecki carried out his research is brief,
conducting studies on evolving drugs of abuse, is, by its
nature, a fluid undertaking with unexpected developments
and uncertain schedules. Pl.'s Resp. 5. Moreover, while
testifying as an expert witness is not an infrequent occurrence
for Dr. Trecki, he does so as a DEA agent, not a career expert
witness searching for additional income. Consequently, the
Court concludes that the time-line of Dr. Trecki's research is
not indicative of his preparing expressly for the purpose of
testifying, and does not weaken the reliability of his opinion.
c. Use Of In Vivo and In Vitro Studies
Finally, Defendant attacks Dr. Trecki's reliance on in vivo and
in vitro studies. Def.'s Mot. to Excl. Trecki 7. These methods
are unreliable, Defendant says, because they view the results
of drug research carried out on animals as representative of
those drugs' effects on humans. Defendant also contends that
the Fifth Circuit has rejected in vitro  and in vivo  studies
to establish causation in humans. Id. at 8; see also Allen
v. Pennsylvania En'g Corp.,  102 F.3d 194 (5th Cir.1996) .9
Defendant goes on to note that evidentiary rulings in criminal
cases are subject heightened scrutiny. Def.'s Reply 7.
In response, the Government again argues that the special
circumstances surrounding controlled substance analogues
necessitate a different standard than the usual scientific
methodology used for testing drugs. Pl.'s Resp. 12; see
also United States v. Klecker,  228 F.Supp.2d 720, 729
(E.D.Va.2002) ( “[T]he use of the term substantially similar
in the Analogue Act creates an entirely different test than
the scientific methodology required in the prescription drug
approval process.”).
*14  The Court recognizes that “evidentiary rulings are
subjected to heightened scrutiny in criminal cases.” United
States v. John,  597 F.3d 263, 274 (5th Cir.2010) . This,
however, does not change the fact that “the rejection of expert
testimony is the exception rather than the rule.” Fed.R.Evid.
702 advisory committee's note. Moreover, while the Fifth
Circuit cautions that “ ‘studies of the effects of chemicals
on animals must be carefully qualified in order to have
explanatory potential for human beings,’ ” it does not hold
them universally invalid as matter of law. Johnson v. Arkema,
685 F.3d 452, 463 (5th Cir.2012) (quoting Allen, 102 F.3d at
197).
The Court concludes that the research and study of controlled
substance analogues is unique and satisfies the careful
qualification requirement for animal studies. Additionally, the
Court is disinclined to exclude testimony that other courts
frequently admit in controlled substance analogue cases. See,
e.g., Nasir, 2013 WL 5373619, at *3  (rejecting defendant's
motion to exclude expert testimony on pharmacological
effect of synthetic cannabinoids based on rodent drug
discrimination tests in controlled substance analogue case);
United States v. McFadden,  No. 3:12CR00009, 2013 WL
8339005, at *5 (W.D.Va. May 10, 2013)  (stating that
expert testimony based on animal studies was properly
admitted in a controlled substance analogue case and that
any “shortcomings identified by the defendant went to the
weight it should be given rather than its admissibility”),
aff'd, 753 F.3d 432 (4th Cir.) . As such, the Court concludes
that Dr. Trecki's reliance on in vivo  and in vitro  studies
was not so fundamentally unreasonable as to render his
opinion unreliable. If Defendant has contrary evidence that
casts doubt on the accuracy of Dr. Trecki's conclusions,
that evidence can be presented at trial. Mathis, 302 F.3d at
461. Accordingly, the exclusion of the whole of Dr. Trecki's
testimony at this time is unwarranted.

IV .
CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, Defendant's Motion to
Exclude Testimony of Plaintiff's Expert Jordan Trecki,
Ph.D., and Motion to Exclude Plaintiff's Expert Michael
L. Van Linn, Ph.D. (Docs.177, 178), are DENIED. Should
it become evident during the trial of this matter that the
testimony of either Dr. Van Linn or Dr. Trecki will not assist
the trier of fact, Defendant may re-urge his objections to such
testimony.

Footnotes
1 On May 20, 2014, a federal grand jury re-alleged the charges in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841 and 846 and, in addition,
charged Bays and three other defendants with violating 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1349 (Conspiracy to Commit Mail Fraud).
Doc. 222, Third Sup. Indictment 3. The conspiracy to commit mail fraud charge, issued after the Defendant filed this
motion, identifies additional chemical substances not mentioned in the previous indictments. Those charges, however,
are not at issue in the instant motion. The pertinent charges in the Third Superseding Indictment arising under 21 U.S.C.
§§ 841 and 846 identify the same four chemical substances as the Second Superseding Indictment: AM2201, 5FPB–22,
PB–22, and 5F–UR–144 (a.k.a.XLR11). Second Sup. Indictment 1–2; Third Sup. Indictment 4 at ¶ 12.
2 A conjunctive reading of 21 U.S.C. § 802(32)(A) was adopted in the following cases: Brown, 415 F.3d at 1261; Turcotte,
405 F.3d at 523; United States v. Roberts, 363 F.3d 118, 121 (2d Cir.2004); United States v. Hodge, 321 F.3d 429, 433
(3d Cir.2003); Washam,  312 F.3d at 930; see Reece, 2013 WL 3865067, at *7 n. 31.
3 The Court notes that Defendant's footnote bears striking resemblance to the Reece court's footnote on the same topic.
Curiously, there is no corresponding citation.
4 The Court notes that Defendant erroneously states that Dr. Van Linn found “the [difference between the] chemical
structures for AM2201 and JWH–018 ... is minor and insignificant given that it consists of only a single atom substitution
and an addition of a single atom,” instead of relaying his actual finding that 5F–PB–22 was substantially similar to AM2201.
Def.'s Mot. to Excl. Van Linn 4–5.
5 The Court notes Defendant's contention that Ms. Reinhold did not find AM2201 and JWH018 were substantially similar,
but instead chemical analogues. Def.'s Reply 4. The Court also dismisses this stance as superfluous; two chemicals
cannot be chemical analogues-under either the Federal definition or Pennsylvania state statute that controlled Ms.
Reinhold's research during the occasion in question-without being substantially similar. See Pl.'s Resp, Ex. A Reinhold
Depo. at 41:17–19; 45:10–13.
6 Defendant relies on Moore, 151 F.3d at 278, which, in pertinent part, states, “[i]n the absence of an established scientific
connection between exposure and illness, or compelling circumstance such as those discussed in Cavallo, the temporal
connection between exposure to chemicals and an onset of symptoms, standing alone, is entitled to little weight in
determining causation.” The Fifth Circuit, in this case, was dealing with a toxic tort claim where the expert in question
failed to produce any scientific support for his conclusion. Indeed, the phrase “unpublished scientific study” does not
appear throughout the entirety of the opinion.
7 The Court notes that the Government lists Carlson, 12–cr–305; Reece, 6:12–cr–146; and The Smoke Shop, LLC, 2:12–
cv–1186 as cases that Dr. Trecki has previously testified in, and provides their case numbers to Defendant so he might
be able to search for available docket sheets.
8 Defendant paraphrases the requirement that “[n]one of these data may be used at any time for any purpose except to
generate reports or other requirements specified in the Statement of Work, without prior written approval of the NIDA
Contracting Officer.” Def.'s Mot. to Excl. Trecki, Ex. 5 at 18, Art. H.8 (emphasis added); see 48 C.F.R. 352.224–70 (2010)
(outlining confidentiality and privacy requirements applicable to NIDA RFP). Notably, the corresponding Statement of
