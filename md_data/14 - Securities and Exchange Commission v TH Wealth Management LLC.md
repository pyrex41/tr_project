ORDER
JANE J. BOYLE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
*1  Before the Court is Defendants TH Wealth Management,
LLC and Brian Keat Hobbs’ Motion for Continuance (Doc.
25). Defendants seek to continue the trial, which is currently
set for October 2, 2023, until February or March 2024. Doc.
25, Mot., 2–3. Although the Court may extend a deadline
upon a showing of good cause, Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b)(1) ,
Defendants have failed to show good cause for an extension
here. Accordingly, the Motion for Continuance (Doc. 25) is
DENIED.
This case was originally set for trial before the Honorable Sam
R. Cummings on September 6, 2022. Doc. 11, Scheduling
Order. Judge Cummings then vacated the trial setting on July
25, 2022. Doc. 14, Order. In February 2023, Judge Cummings
reset the trial for October 2, 2023. Doc. 18, Order. In June
2023, the case was reassigned to this Court. Doc. 20, Special
Order. The Court then ordered the parties to provide “an
update as to the current status of this case” as well as “a
proposed litigation timeline or updated scheduling order, if
required.” Doc. 21, Status Report Order.
The parties responded with a Joint Status Report. Doc.
22, Joint Status Report. In the report, Defendants’
counsel discussed potential conflicts but also unequivocally
confirmed that “the Parties [were] ready to proceed with the
jury trial in this case ... on October 2, 2023.” Id. at 1. Relying
on that assertion, the Court issued an Amended Scheduling
Order (Doc. 23). Defendants now move to continue the trial.
Doc. 25, Mot. Defendants first highlight that their counsel has
another trial that conflicts with the trial setting in this case.
Id. at 2. Defendants also indicate they need additional time
to designate an expert following a recent deposition. See id.
Neither reason provides good cause to continue the trial date.
As to the scheduling conflict, this case was first filed on
December 18, 2020. Doc. 1, Compl. Trial was initially set
for almost one year ago. See Doc. 11, Scheduling Order. And
while the continuance was not the fault of the parties, the
current October trial date has now been set for five months.
See Doc. 18, Order (resetting trial date on February 13, 2023).
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) also
contends that, per a conversation with the court coordinator of
the conflicting state case, the state case was set for trial three
months ago (i.e., two months after this case). Doc. 28, Searles
Decl., ¶ 3. Finally, the state case is a one-day trial that the state
court is amenable to moving. Id. In short, therefore, trial in
this case is long overdue, this trial was set first, and the one-
day trial in the state court can be moved.
As to Defendants’ contention that they need more time
for expert disclosures, their arguments are unconvincing.
Most importantly, Defendants have not explained the subject
matter of any expert testimony they are considering or
how the recent deposition implicates such expert testimony.
See id.  ¶ 4; see also  Doc. 25, Mot. Similarly, under the
original scheduling order, Defendants were required to make
expert disclosures by early June 2022. See Fed. R. Civ. P.
26(a)(2)(D) (providing that expert disclosures are due 90
days before trial); see also Doc. 11, Scheduling Order. But
Defendants made no disclosures then. Doc. 28, Searles Decl.,
¶ 6. Nor have they made any expert disclosures in this
case by the now-passed deadline. See id.  The lack of any
expert disclosures—then or now—undermines Defendants’
contention that more time is suddenly needed for expert
disclosures in this case.

*2  In sum, Defendants’ arguments regarding scheduling
conflicts and expert disclosures do not provide good cause
to continue this trial. The Motion for Continuance (Doc. 25)
is therefore DENIED.
SO ORDERED.
