MEMORANDUM ORDER
JANE J. BOYLE, United States District Judge.
*1  Before the Court are Defendant's Motion to Strike
Designated Expert (doc. 21) and Plaintiff's Amended Motion
to Exclude Expert Testimony (doc. 24). This suit arises out
of Allstate Insurance Company's denial of an insurance claim
that its insured, Dwight Glasgow, now deceased, made on a
homeowner's insurance policy for damage to his home caused
by fire. Allstate claims that Glasgow intentionally set the
blaze, and it denied coverage on that basis. Mitch Launius,
as independent administrator of Glasgow's estate, filed this
suit against Allstate for breach of the contract of insurance
between Glasgow and Allstate and for violations of the Texas
Deceptive Trade Practices Act and the Texas Insurance Code.
Allstate designated David Sneed, a fire consultant, as
an expert witness in this matter. Sneed conducted an
investigation of the fire on February 5, 2002 and issued a
report on April 2, 2002 regarding the origin and cause of
the fire. (App. to Def.'s Mot. to Strike Designated Expert
[“Def.App.”] at 2). Sneed concluded that the fire was set
intentionally through the introduction and ignition of gasoline
inside a 1988 Toyota Camry parked in Glasgow's driveway
and on top of a 1984 Oldsmobile Cutlass parked in the garage.
(Id. at 5-6). Launius seeks to exclude Sneed's testimony on
the basis that Sneed is not qualified to testify as an expert
witness and because his opinions are not reliable.
Launius has designated Gerald Hurst as an expert. Hurst has
a doctoral degree in chemistry from Cambridge University
and has over 30 years of experience in studying the initiation
and prevention of fires and in analyzing fires and explosions.
(App. to Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s Mot. to Strike [“Pl.'s Resp.App.”]
at 1). In his report Hurst primarily criticizes the observations
and findings of Sneed's investigation, and he puts forth
various alternative accidental causes of the fire. ( Id. at 2-8).
He stated at his deposition that he is “not certain about the
origin of this fire” ( id. at 25), but he states in his report
that “the most probable cause of the subject fire was the
ignition of a layer of dry leaves on the driveway surface
by either the exhaust system or the electrical system of the
Toyota automobile.” (Id. at 8). Allstate argues that Hurst is
not qualified to testify about fire investigation and that his
opinions are unreliable.
The Court finds that both Sneed and Hurst are qualified to
testify as expert witnesses. Under Federal Rule of Evidence
702, an expert must be qualified by knowledge, skill,
experience, training or education. Fed.R.Evid. 702. An expert
must possess a higher degree of knowledge or experience
about an issue than an ordinary person would. See Mukhtar
v. California State Univ.,  299 F.3d 1053, 1065 n. 9 (9th
Cir.2002), amended by 319 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir.2003) . Since
1997, Sneed has been certified as a fire investigator by
International Association of Arson Investigators (“IAAI”),
one of two organizations that certify fire instructors in the
United States. (App. to Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Am. Mot. to
Exclude Expert Testimony [“Def. Resp.App.”] at 14). Sneed
has worked as a fire consultant since 1996, focusing on the
investigation of losses due to fire, explosion, product liability
and fraud. ( Id. at 18). Launius suggests that Sneed is not
qualified to testify as an expert because he has no formal
higher-level education in chemistry or the physical sciences.
The mere lack of a academic training or formal college
education will not render expert testimony inadmissible,
however. See Dresser v. Cradle of Hope Adoption Ctr.,
Inc., 421 F.Supp.2d 1024, 1033 (E.D.Mich.2006) . “ Rule

702 specifically contemplates the admission of testimony
by experts whose knowledge is based on experience.” See
United States v. Parra,  402 F.3d 752, 758 (7th Cir.2005)
(quoting Smith v. Ford Motor Co.,  215 F.3d 713, 718 (7th
Cir.2000)). Sneed unquestionably has experience in the field
of fire investigation, and he accordingly is qualified to testify
on that subject at trial.
*2  For his part, Hurst has been self-employed since 1980 as
an explosion and fire analysis consultant. (Pl. Resp.App. at
1). In recent years he has analyzed fires in alleged arson and
arson/murder cases in various state and federal jurisdictions.
(Id.). Hurst is a member of the IAAI, but he is not a Certified
Fire Instructor. (Def.App. at 123-124). He is also a member
of the National Fire Protection Association and the American
Chemical Society. (Pl. Resp.App. at 26). The Court finds that
Hurst's educational background and experience has endowed
him with a higher degree of knowledge about the field of
fire investigation and/or analysis than a layperson and that his
testimony will accordingly assist the trier of fact to determine
the facts at issue in this case.
Each party also argues that the other's respective expert fails
to satisfy the reliability requirements of Daubert v. Merrell
Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,  509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786,
125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993) . The Court finds that the parties'
concerns over the presentation of “shaky” expert testimony
can be addressed through forceful cross examination and the
presentation of contrary evidence at trial. See Daubert, 509
U.S. at 596;  Mathis v. Exxon Corp.,  302 F.3d 448, 461 (5th
Cir.2002). “[I]f it becomes apparent in trial that some of
the testimony will not assist the trier of fact to understand
the evidence, [the parties] may object to such testimony.”
See Hidalgo v. Cooley Godward,  2004 WL 936859, at *3
(N.D.Tex. April 1, 2004).
For the foregoing reasons the Court DENIES Defendant's
Motion to Strike Designated Expert (doc. 21) and Plaintiff's
Amended Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony (doc. 24).
The Court further DENIES Plaintiff's original Motion to
Exclude Expert Testimony (doc. 19) as moot.
SO ORDERED.
